Question 3. Short Answers [16 marks] 
a) Spin lock is a type of lock that causes a thread to try to acquire the lock in a tight loop. For example: 
 
while(test_and_set(&lock) != 0); 
 
test_and_set is an atomic operation that sets the value of lock to 1 and simultaneously returns 
the old value.  
 
i. 
Would you use a spinlock on a uniprocessor system? If yes, is there a precondition for its use, 
and what is it? If no, why not? [2 marks] 
 
No – you should always go to sleep immediately if you cannot acquire block because you 
would otherwise hog CPU and not allowing other threads to run in the meantime. 
 
This answer is also accepted: 
 
Yes – if the wait time is expected to be less than the time to perform a context switch. 
 
 
ii. 
Would you use a spinlock on a multiprocessor system? If yes, is there a precondition for its use, 
and what is it? If no, why not? [3 marks] 
 
Yes – as long as the wait time is less than time to perform a context switch or if there are few 
threads running (e.g., there’s no threads to run even if you go to sleep). 
  
 
 
 
 
 
b) In C++, suppose Fred is a subclass of Flob, and foo() is a virtual method in class Bar that returns a 
pointer to class Flob. Is it legal for a subclass of Bar to override foo() and change the return type to 
a pointer to class Fred? What is the name of this language feature, regardless of whether or not C++ 
supports it? [2 marks] 
 
Yes – Covariant Return Type.

c) Show an example of shadowing for C++, Python, and Rust. For example:  
 
class A: foo = 0 
class B(A): foo = 1 
 
You should circle the variable that is shadowed. You may not use the example above, or a 
derivative of it, to receive any marks for Python. Your answer must clearly show the scope of each 
variable involved. Add comments if it helps clarify your example. [9 marks]

Question 4. Object-Oriented Programming [14 marks] 
You are working with a graphical toolkit that provides the following interface and widgets: 
struct Input { 
    virtual const string & getvalue() const=0; 
    virtual void draw() const=0; 
}; 
 
class Select : public Input { 
    vector<string> choices; 
    int index; 
public: 
    void set_index(int i) { index = i; } 
    virtual const string & getvalue() const override; 
    virtual void draw() const override; 
}; 
 
struct Text : public Input { 
    string value; 
public: 
    virtual const string & getvalue() const override; 
    virtual void draw() const override; 
}; 
 
You wish to implement a new class, Suggest, which allows the users to narrow down on the 
choices available in Select as they type (think Google Suggest).  
 
a) Draw the data layout of the Suggest class using multiple inheritance, inherit Select first, then 
Text. Note: sizeof(vector<string>) is 24, and sizeof(string) is 32. [5 marks] 
 
 
Suggest /* nothing */ 
Text 
value:   32 bytes

b) What is the size of the Suggest class implemented using multiple inheritance? [1 mark] 
80 bytes 
 
c) Define the Suggest class using multiple inheritance. Next implement the interface functions 
getvalue and draw. getvalue should return the value returned by Select, and draw should 
draw the Select widget first before Text. [4 marks] 
 
class Suggest : Select, Text { 
public: 
    virtual const string & getvalue() const override {  
        return Select::getvalue();  
    } 
    virtual void draw() const override  {  
        Select::draw(); 
        Text::draw(); 
    } 
}; 
 
 
d) Define the Suggest class again using composition. Note that Suggest must still be a subclass of 
Input. Do not implement either interface functions (just declare them). [4 marks] 
 
class Suggest : Input { 
    Select select; 
    Text text; 
public: 
    virtual const string & getvalue() const override {  
        return select.getvalue();  
    } 
    virtual void draw() const override  {  
        select.draw(); 
        text.draw(); 
    }

Question 5. Template Metaprogramming [15 marks] 
a) Complete the template metafunction, is_mapper, that checks whether type F is a function or a 
functor that takes one parameter: type T, and returns type T. [9 marks] 
 
is_same<int, decltype(123)>::value // this evaluates to true 
 
Hint: you should use make use of is_same, shown above, to check the return type of type F. 
template<typename T, typename F, typename=void> 
struct is_mapper : false_type {}; 
 
 
template<typename T, typename F> 
struct is_mapper<T, F, void_t<decltype(

Question 6. Reflective Programming [17 marks] 
a) Python property can actually be implemented using a descriptor. Implement a simplified version of 
property, named Property, that supports calling a read function fget upon attribute read, calling a 
write function fset upon attribute write, but does not support delete. If fget is None, then the 
attribute is write-only. If fset is None, then the attribute is read-only. In either of these cases, 
raise AttributeError with the message, “operation not supported”. [10 marks] 
class Property: 
    def __init__(self, fget=None, fset=None): 
 
        self.fget = fget 
        self.fset = fset

Question 8. Concurrent Programming [27 marks] 
In a peculiar home with mice and cats, they share an extra-large bowl of food together. The rules at this 
house is that the cats must eat alone, while the mice can eat together, up to 6 of them at once. When a cat 
wants to eat, it has priority over any mouse that wants to eat. The mice who are already eating must 
finish up and leave. If another cat is eating, the other cat must wait for its turn.  
Given the following shared data structure: 
enum Eater { NONE, CATS, MICE, } 
struct Bowl { 
    eater: Eater, // which kind of animal is eating right now 
    count: i32,   // number of animals eating together (mice only)

Question 9. Functional Programming [15 marks] 
a) Complete the following generic function, average, such that it returns the arithmetic average of 
the type parameter T. Your solution must make use of the fold iterator adaptor, and must be able 
to handle an empty list correctly without crashing. [7 marks] 
fn average<T>(list: & Vec<T>) -> T  
where T: Copy + Add<Output=T> + Default + From<u32> + Div<Output=T>  
{ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    if list.len() == 0 { 
        Default::default() 
    }       
    else { 
        list.iter().fold(Default::default(), |ac: T, v: &T| ac + *v)

b) Given a CSV (comma-separated values) file where the first row contains the header of each column 
and the remaining rows are values. For example: 
last, first, player_nr 
Lowry, Kyle, 7 
Siakam, Pascal, 43 
Gasol, Marc, 33 
 
Write a generator that takes in the name of a file, opens the file, get the header row, and for each 
subsequent row, yields a dictionary where the keys are the header values. For example, the first 
dictionary that should be returned is: 
 
{'last': 'Lowry', 'first': 'Kyle', 'player_nr': '7'} 
 
You are required to make use of the zip built-in function. You may assume the file is correctly 
formatted, but you must strip whitespaces for each input token. (e.g. from ‘ last’ to ‘last’)  [8 marks]

            values = [ s.strip() for s in line.split(",") ] 
            yield dict(zip(headers, values))
