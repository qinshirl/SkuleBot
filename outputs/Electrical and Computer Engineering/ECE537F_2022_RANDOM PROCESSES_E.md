UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO
DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL & COMPUTER ENGINEERING
ECE 537F
Random Processes
Final Exam
December 13, 2022 
Time: 2:00 PM - 4:30 PM
Examiner: Prof. Elvino S. Sousa
Instructions:
1.
Type X exam.
Answer all 5 questions. All 5 questions have equal value.
Write the answer to each question beginning on a new page of the exam booklet.
Answers must be clear and show justification. Merely writing down a correct final 
answer without any trace as to how the answer was obtained will not receive a 
favourable grade. Neatly written answers will receive more favourable consideration 
in part-mark evaluation.
Formulate your answers clearly using well defined constants if necessary and then 
separately evaluate any calculations.

1. Consider a discrete time random process where the are i.i.d. random variables with 
uniform distribution in the interval [0,1] for n > 0, and 0 for n < 0. Now, define the 
process hn = 
+ ^X^^z-
a) Determine the mean of the process Y^, my (n).
b) Determine the correlation function for the process /?y(ni,n2).
c) Is the process Yn Wide Sense Stationary (WSS)? Justify your answer.
d) Determine the covariance function for the process Y^.
e) Is the process Yj^ ergodic in the mean?
f) Now modify the process X^ so that the are i.i.d. random variables with the same 
uniform distribution for all n. Determine the auto-correlation function.
g) Is the modified process in f) WSS?
2. Consider a Poisson process N(t) with parameter A — 2 arrivals per unit time.
a) Give the probability mass function (PMF) for N(5).
b) Consider the random variables X = yV(5) and Y = N(6). Give the joint PMF for the 
random variables X and Y.
c) Determine the correlation and the covariance for X and Y.
d) Let r be a random variable denoting the time of the 
arrival. Determine the PDF for
T.
e) Given that N (4) = 2, what is the probability that the time of the first arrival is less than
1?
3. Consider a WSS discrete time random process X^ = Zn + aN^. The processes Z„ and 
are uncorrelated. The auto-correlation function for is Rzim) = 2 
and is
discrete time white noise with variance cr^y = 1. We wish to estimate the signal Z„ in terms 
of the signals 
and X^-s, i.e. form the estimate of Z„, T„ = h^X^-i +
|7n|
^2^71-2 + ^3^n-3-
a) Assuming a = 1, find a set of equations whose solution is the set of filter coefficients 
hi, h2, h^.
b) Give an expression that can be computed to determine the estimation error.
c) Now assume that a = 0, i.e. no noise, give the set of equations whose solution is the 
set of filter coefficients.
d) For the case in c) give the estimation error.

4. Consider the sequence of Poisson distributed independent random variables Z„ with 
S(Zn) = Under each of the following criterion state whether or not the sequence Z„ 
converges. If so, state the limit. Prove or disprove the corresponding convergence assertion.
a) Convergence in probability.
b) Convergence in the mean-square sense.
c) Convergence in distribution.
d) Convergence almost surely.
5. In a school game a boy hops along the vertices of a pentagon which are numbered 0 to 4 in 
the counter-clockwise direction. He tosses a die and takes a number of hops according to 
the outcome of the toss. If the outcome is even he remains in the same vertex. If the 
outcome is 1 he hops to vertex 0. Otherwise he hops a number of vertices counter-clockwise 
equal to the number in the outcome of the toss. Let be a discrete time random process 
equal to the vertex number where the boy stands at time n.
a) Give an argument to show that is a Markov Chain.
b) Is the Markov chain homogeneous? Justify your answer.
c) Draw a diagram to represent the Markov chain including the transition probabilities.
d) Write a set of equations that can be solved to obtain the steady state probabilities for 
the different states of the Markov chain. Specify clearly how these equations are to be 
solved.
e) Use the law of total probability to determine the probability vector for the state at time 
n = 1 given that at time n = 0 the state probability vector has equal probability 
components.
