UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO - FACULTY OF APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 
The Edward S. Rogers Sr. Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering 
MAT290H1F: ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS - COURSE SYLLABUS FOR FALL 2025 
 
BASIC COURSE 
DESCRIPTION 
This is a course designed to prepare students for use of essential mathematical concepts and 
techniques for Electrical and Computer Engineering applications. It covers basics of 
Complex Analysis, Differential Equations and Laplace Transforms. Topics include: ordinary 
linear differential equations; transform methods; complex numbers and the complex plane; 
the logarithmic and exponential functions; complex functions; limits and continuity; 
derivatives and integrals; analytic functions and the Cauchy-Riemann equations; power 
series as analytic functions; Cauchy's integral theorem, Cauchy's integral formula, Laurent 
series, the Residue Theorem, computation of real integrals using residues, the inversion 
formula for the Laplace transform. Examples are drawn mostly from electrical circuit 
systems.  Official calendar description can be found here.

LEARNING 
OUTCOMES 
• Formulate mathematical models for circuits. 
• Gain mastery of various methods (including but not limited to use of the Laplace Transform) for 
solving corresponding ordinary differential equations and for interpreting the results. 
• Learn and understand basic theorems of Complex Analysis. 
• Use Complex Analysis methods to compute certain integrals and inverse Laplace transforms. 
 
HOMEWORK 
It is essential for your success in the course, and for your learning experience, that you work 
through all the homework problems assigned each week before attending your tutorial.

WEEKLY 
READING 
ASSIGNMENTS 
In each week's problem set a reading assignment will be included. The lectures in this course are 
designed to explain the most important and/or difficult parts of the textbook, so not every detail of the 
material which you are responsible for will be discussed in lectures. Make sure you work through 
the assigned sections of the book. 
 
The weakly readings will also help you keep up in this course, which covers a great deal of material. 
It is a small investment that will make a big difference when you go to write your quizzes and final 
exam 
 
QUIZZES 
We will have 5 quizzes this semester. These are meant to test whether you have understood the 
lectures, read the assigned sections in the textbook and have solved the homework problems. 
There will be no make-up quizzes. The first quiz is scheduled for Friday Sept. 26 in your 5-6 pm 
tutorials. Further details about the quizzes will be posted on the Quercus page of the course. 
 
COURSE 
MARKS 
Quizzes 55%, Final Exam 45% 
The final exam is mandatory for all students. Assessed grades will not be provided to students  
with approved examination petitions; instead, a deferred exam will be scheduled. 
      
Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances, dates and percentages of the course assessments 
are subject to change. 
 
STATEMENT ON 
INCLUSIVITY 
You belong here. The University of Toronto Engineering commits to all students, instructors, staff, 
alumni and partners that you can learn, create and participate in a welcoming, healthy and 
respectful environment. In this class, the participation and perspectives of everyone is invited and 
encouraged. The broad range of identities and intersections of identities within an inclusive team 
environment will help you achieve academic success. You can read the evidence for this approach 
here:  https:/www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/business-case-for-diversity-in-the-workplace/. 
You are not alone. You are invited to talk to anyone in the Faculty that you feel comfortable 
approaching, including your professor, teaching assistant, academic advisor, any staff member, the 
Engineering Equity Diversity & Inclusion Action Group, a culture or identity club or group, or a U 
of T Equity Office.

LAND 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of 
years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the 
Credit. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle 
Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

STATEMENT ON 
ACCOMODATIONS 
The University of Toronto supports accommodations for students with diverse learning needs, which may 
be associated with mental health conditions, learning disabilities, autism spectrum, ADHD, mobility 
impairments, functional/fine motor impairments, concussion or head injury, visual impairments, chronic 
health conditions, addictions, D/deaf, deafened or hard of hearing, communication disorders and/or 
temporary disabilities, such as fractures and severe sprains, or recovery from an operation. 
 
If you have a learning need requiring an accommodation the University of Toronto recommends that 
students register with Accessibility Services as soon as possible. Register at: 
https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/accessibility-services-registration-and-documentation-requirements/  
 
We know that many students avoid seeking help because they feel that they should not need “unfair 
advantages.” The purpose of academic accommodation is not to give an unfair advantage, but to help 
remove an unfair disadvantage. It may feel difficult to ask for help, but it can make all the difference 
during your time here.

STATEMENT ON 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
Engineering at the University of Toronto is a demanding program. The workload and the frequency of 
assignments and tests can be challenging to balance and can feel overwhelming. As a result, students can 
find themselves experiencing physical and/or mental health issues which impact their academic 
performance and overall well-being. 
 
If you find yourself feeling distressed and in need of more immediate support resources, consider 
reaching out to the counsellors at My Student Support Program (MySSP) (www.uoft.me/myssp) or 
visiting U of T Engineering’s Urgent Support – Talk to Someone Right Now webpage 
(https://uofteng.ca/talknow). 
 
If you are encountering challenges that significantly affect your academic performance and overall 
wellbeing, there are a variety of free and confidential supports that can help you. As a U of T Engineering 
student, you have a First-Year Advisor (www.uoft.me/fyo), a Departmental Upper-Year 
Undergraduate Advisor (www.uoft.me/engadvisors), or a Departmental Graduate Administrator 
(www.uoft.me/gradadmin) who can advise on personal matters that impact your academics. You can find 
helpful people, services and resources like these listed on the U of T Engineering Mental Health & 
Wellness webpage (www.uofteng.ca/mentalhealth).
