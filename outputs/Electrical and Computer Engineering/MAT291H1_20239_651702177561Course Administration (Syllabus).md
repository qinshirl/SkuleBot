Department of Mathematics, University of Toronto 
MAT291H1F - Calculus III 
Course Administration (Syllabus) - Fall 2023 
 
Brief Course Description 
 
This is the first course in multivariable calculus, covering:  
 
• functions of several variables, graphing techniques, limits, continuity, the directional 
derivative, and the gradient,  
• multiple integrals and the Jacobian,  
• line integrals, surface integrals, divergence, and curl of a vector field, 
• Divergence theorem and Stokes' theorem in 3d and how they are applied in an application 
context,  
• Green's Flux theorem and Circulation theorem, which are a 2d version of the Divergence 
theorem and Stokes' theorem respectively. 
 
Students will be required to solve standard computational problems and understand the main 
concepts, definitions, and the main theorems in each section covered. Developing your ability to 
think precisely and mathematically is an important objective. The foundations of many courses 
you will take in your remaining two years are based on the material that we will cover in this 
course. Your instructors and TAs are available to help online either through Piazza or Office Hours 
should you encounter any difficulty. 
 
Note: all items marked in black and bolded, except for section headings, relate to issues that 
could or will impact your grade. 
Course Material 
 
The course consists of the following Mandatory and Supplementary material: 
Mandatory:  
1. Selected sections from a textbook   
2. Reading Assignment 3 (Short) 
3. Extracted Lecture notes from Reading Assignments 0,1,2,4, and 5. 
 
Supplementary: 
1. Archived Lecture Notes and Lecture Videos 
2. Archived Tutorial Notes and Tutorial Videos 
3. Extended Reading Assignments (Full Version) and Solutions 
 
Textbook 
 
The main textbook for this course is "Calculus: Early Transcendentals, 3rd Edition” (Chapters 
13.5,13.6, 15 (excluding 15.7 and 15.8), Chapter 16 (excluding 16.4 and 16.6) and problems from

Chapter 17 which are embedded in Reading Assignment 4 (Short and Full Version) and the 
Extracted Notes). A detailed description of the textbook purchase options from the publisher 
appears at the following link (Purchase of Textbook). 
 
Archived Lecture Notes and Lecture Videos 
The archived lecture videos are organized so that the first slide of each lecture indicates: 
 
• where the material has been extracted from 
• objectives 
• concepts, tooling, and visualization skills that you will be exposed to 
 
The second slide is a summary of the contents of the video. The remaining slides introduce the 
concepts, but in many cases, the last part of the video (pdf Notes) includes a selection of worked 
out problems. Many of the problems have been extracted from the textbook. 
 
Class Notes 
 
Class Notes are a guide for each in-person lecture and have been extracted from the Archived 
Video Lecture notes. The notes contain slides and some recommended problems to work on. The 
notes should be reviewed, and the problems attempted, after the lecture.  
 
Reading Assignments 
There are 5 Reading Assignments (Short) from which lecture material has been extracted. The 
Reading Assignments (Short) have been posted on Quercus and were extracted themselves from 
an even more extensive set of notes (Extended Reading Assignments (Full Versions)) that are 
also posted on Quercus for additional reference or curiosity. 
• 
Reading Assignment 0 consolidates the relevant information you learned last year along with 
some new material. The introductory parts of Reading Assignment 0 are posted in the form 
of extracted notes and should be reviewed before classes begin. 
• 
Reading Assignments 1 and 2 (Short) add material which is important in Engineering 
Mathematics but is not covered in the textbook. 
• 
Reading Assignment 3 (Short) is a replacement of Section 16.4 of the textbook, with some 
modifications. This is the only Reading Assignment that you are responsible for and is 
assigned in Week 5. 
• 
Reading Assignment 4 (Short) is a direct replacement and reorganization of Section 17 in 
the textbook. 
• 
Reading Assignment 5 (Short) is focused on applying the Divergence Theorem and Stokes’ 
Theorem to problems of physical interest. There is no textbook that covers this material. The 
last quiz and two out of six questions on the final exam are based on Reading Assignment 5. 
33% of the final exam grade will be based on Reading Assignment 5 so make sure you 
manage your time appropriately. You will apply the material in Assignment 5 (Short) in the 
electric and magnetics field course ECE221 next term. Circuits, as taught this term in

ECE212, are a natural extension to the material in this set of notes, which provides the 
foundation upon which guiding principles of analysis, such as Kirchoff’s Voltage and 
Current laws, are based. 
The material in Reading Assignment 4 (Short) and Reading Assignment 5 (Short) will fill in some 
technical gaps in the textbook and thus give you the information you require in courses taken in 
the second semester of the second year and the third and fourth years. Notes that you are 
responsible for have been extracted from these Reading Assignments. You are only responsible 
for Reading Assignments 3 (Short) and selected sections of Reading Assignment 5 (Short). The 
Reading Assignments (Short) have been posted on Quercus. 
You are responsible for the Class Notes, Class Note solutions, and all Extracted Lecture notes 
taken from the Reading Assignments. All other content is supplementary and for your own 
additional information/benefit.

Note: If you miss a quiz because of sickness and have submitted a valid petition, then your final 
exam will be counted proportionately higher.  
 
Missed Quiz 
 
Students can submit one term-work petition per term without documentation through the 
Engineering Portal under the following restrictions:  
 
• A petition supported by a self-declaration of illness (i.e., without medical documentation) 
may not cover a period longer than three days.  
• Any missed term work valued at 15% or greater will require a signed  Verification of Illness 
(VOI)  (VOI) form.  
• A student may not self-declare an illness if they miss an exam. All exam petitions require 
supporting documentation.  
• A student may only self-declare their absence once per term. Documentation must be 
provided for all other petitions submitted within that same term.  
 
The Verification of Illness (VOI) is being re-introduced for all term-work and final exam petitions, 
except for the one term-work petition without documentation under the guidelines listed above.  
 
Refer to this link: 
 
https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/petitions/term-work-petitions/ 
 
If you do not submit a valid petition for missing a quiz, then you will be assigned a grade of 0 for 
that quiz. Any concerns regarding the petition process should be discussed with the undergraduate 
counsellor leanne.dawkins@utoronto.ca. 
Regrading Policy 
 
A given quiz will be graded by the same grader, to ensure consistency. The graders for the course 
are known in advance on Gradescope, however, for your convenience the following table gives 
you the information briefly:

Re-grading Procedure 
 
Any given quiz is graded by a single grader to ensure consistency. All questions will be graded 
using a transparent rubric which can be found on Gradescope along with your quiz results. If you 
feel that the grader made a mistake or missed some of the work, you may request a regrade request 
directly on Gradescope. Regrade requests will open 2 days after your quiz is returned to you 
and close 5 days after the quiz is returned. All regrade requests must be made in this 3-day 
window. 
 
To make the regrade request, open Gradescope to your graded quiz and select the question you 
would like regraded. Then press the "request regrade" button on the bottom left corner. You must 
provide a clear and detailed reason for your regrade request. Your reasoning must specifically 
reference the Gradescope rubric to justify your request. Please note that we will not respond to 
frivolous requests. An addition error is an obvious reason for a regrade. All regrade requests will 
be handled by the grader for that quiz to ensure consistency and fairness. Please note that 
regrading may result in your mark being lowered.  
Final Exam 
 
A question-by-question summary of what the final exam will cover will be posted in the last week 
of term, or not later than the weekend before your scheduled exam. The exam covers some of the 
material from the textbook, material from Reading Assignment 3, extracted Lecture Notes 17-25D 
and certain sections of Reading Assignment 5 (Short) which will be stated explicitly during the 
last week of term. No solutions to prior final exams will be posted. All programmable calculators 
will be disallowed (Type 4) and the exam is a closed book exam (Type A). This could change 
if exams are done online.  We will keep you posted in case of any changes.

the Code of Behavior on Academic Matters. 
• You must follow the proper petition process if you miss a quiz due to sickness. Forgery of 
a medical certificate could leave you liable for a violation of the Code of Behavior on 
Academic Matters. Any concerns regarding the petition process should be discussed with the 
undergraduate counsellor leanne.dawkins@utoronto.ca.  
• Academic integrity is a serious issue. Please refer to the resources published by the Office of 
Academic 
Integrity 
for 
more 
information 
on 
academic 
offences: 
https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/perils-and-pitfalls/

Office Hour Format 
 
The instructor and tutorial assistants for the course will hold weekly office hours. The time and 
locations are listed in the module titled  ‘Office hour schedule” on Quercus.  Office hours will start 
the week of September 11. Office hours are for generic problems associated with previous material 
which you had a problem understanding or concepts that you are still struggling with. Questions 
related to the assigned problems should be discussed with your TA or posted on Piazza. We 
have several TAs including the instructors who will respond to your questions within an hour or 
so. All office hours are by appointment, and you are welcome to attend office hours for any 
instructor or TA.  
Before the Q&A/office hour sessions, please do the following: 
 
• Try the exercises in the last column of Table 3 of  MAT291 Lecture Schedule and Assigned 
Problems

• If you have questions about the problems in Table 3 of MAT291 Lecture Schedule and 
Assigned Problems, please email them 24 hours in advance to your TA with the subject 
“MAT291 Q&A question” and they will be answered in the Q&A session.  
• If your question is not related to the current tutorial video or material outlined in Table 3 for 
that week, then please send a question with the heading “MAT291 office hour question” and 
it will be answered during the office hour. Alternatively, post your question on Piazza. 
During an online office hour session: 
 
• Please kindly mute your microphone while you are not talking, especially if your room has a 
lot of background noise. 
• Your TA/instructor may either prepare typed or hand-written notes to answer the questions 
(which is why it is critical that you prepare them in advance). They may also write the 
answers in real-time or use a combination of real-time writing and prepared notes. 
• During the office hours you may take screenshots if you want, but we will not be uploading 
any notes on Quercus. 
 
Remark requests are NOT handled by your tutorial TA, but by the grading TA. However, if 
you need some clarification on concepts relating to the solution, we can still address those during 
office hours.
