Course Overview:  
This course involves completing a large software project in a team and 
communicating effectively with both technical supervisors and less technical 
project managers. The course focuses on practical skills in all these areas -- design, 
software development, oral and written communication, project management 
and teamwork – as these skills are essential to having a successful engineering 
career. The evaluation is similarly practical: your grade will be based on the 
quality of your software design, the calibre of your oral and written 
communication, and your project management. 
 
The information concerning the course project and evaluation is subject to 
change if circumstances warrant; such changes will be communicated to students 
as early as possible if they are necessary. 
Learning Outcomes: 
By the end of this course, students will be able to: 
 
Write clear documents and incorporate relevant background research. 
 
Create memorable and informative oral presentations. 
 
Work effectively in a team and communicate status succinctly. 
 
Use agile software development techniques and modern software development tools, including 
revision control, debuggers, code verifiers, and unit tests. 
 
Choose appropriate data structures for efficiency and implement them using the C++ STL library.

project; there is a tentative schedule later in this syllabus. 
The week of Jan. 22 you will meet your Communication Instructor (CI) at the start of your 
tutorial and choose a weekly meeting time (which might be during your tutorial time slot, or 
at some other time). From Jan. 29 onwards your team of three will meet with your 
Communication Instructor during that agreed-upon time. If your CI meeting overlaps part of 
a coding tutorial you can watch the video of that portion of the tutorial. 
Labs:  
Labs start right away, the week of January 8. There are three time slots and four rooms.

For the January 8 – January 19 lab periods (2 labs), you will work individually to learn the 
software development infrastructure of the course and can work in any lab room. From 
January 22 onwards, you will work in teams of three in the lab and will be assigned a specific 
TA to mentor & grade your team and a specific lab room. 
You should attend your lab period to meet with your TA and teammates each week and work 
on your project. This time will not be sufficient to complete the project, so you should also

expect to do some work outside the lab. You can use the computers in the lab rooms outside 
of course hours; the entry code for the lab rooms is 16384. There are also two ways to work 
remotely: using the VNC windowing software to log into a UG computer, or using a virtual 
machine we provide that replicates the lab machine setup on your home computer. Details 
are in the VNC and virtual machine quick start guides on quercus.

Project and Organization: 
In this course you will build a Geographic Information System (GIS) software program that will let you 
visualize and solve travel and optimization problems in maps of any city of the world. By the end of the 
course your program will be able to  
 
Read in a database of all the intersections and streets and other geographic features in a city 
and organize it into appropriate data structures. 
 
Draw the resulting map nicely and let the user interact (pan, zoom, highlight, search for 
locations, etc.) with it. 
 
Find good travel routes between intersections in the city and give directions to a user. 
 
Find a good order of deliveries and a good driving path for a courier company driver to complete 
his/her list of daily deliveries.

You will be evaluated by two people in this course. 
1. A Teaching Assistant (TA), who is a graduate student in engineering and will mentor you on design 
and software development, and evaluate the quality of your software project.  
 
2. A Communication Instructor (CI), who is trained in effective communication and will mentor you 
on oral and written communication, and who will evaluate your written documents and most of 
your oral presentations. 
You will work in teams of three students, and you will choose your teammates. All three team members 
must be in the same time slot for labs and for tutorials, to make scheduling meetings with the teaching 
assistants and communication instructors feasible. You must choose your team members and enter your 
team on Quercus by Jan. 19; if you can’t find team members we will assign you to a team in the 3rd week 
of the course. Each team will then be assigned one CI and one TA, who will mentor you and grade you for 
the duration of the course.

Detailed Deliverables and Evaluation 
Your mark will be determined by the quality of your design and software, your oral and written 
communication, and how well you manage your project and how professionally you communicate your 
status throughout the course. The detailed list of deliverables and the mark distribution are given below. 
Full details on the requirements for each software or communication deliverable will be given in separate 
documents distributed when that deliverable is assigned later in the course.

Exam 
Period  
CI and TA. Final oral presentation 
summarizing what your program achieves; it 
is intended for an engineering management 
audience. Describe the interesting features 
and algorithms of your program, including 
screenshots or a video, and give a “pitch” for 
a future feature you could develop to 
address some business or social opportunity. 
 
 
Shaded deliverables will be completed individually; other deliverables will be completed by a team of 
three students. Note that while you will complete most deliverables as a team, the marks of individual 
team members can be different based on the relative contribution of each team member and the quality 
and scope of the portion of the design / document / presentation created by each team member.  
 
Submission deadlines will be at 11:59 pm of the date in question. When a demo is required it will be done 
during your next lab period after the submission deadline. The milestone (software code) submission 
deadlines are firm as completing a project on time is a key part of project management. It is also important 
to realize that you can’t achieve a perfect solution on a project; you are seeking a “good enough” solution 
in a reasonable time. The electronic submission procedure is disabled after the due date and late 
submissions will be accepted only in exceptional circumstances (contact the instructors if you feel you 
have such a circumstance). You should plan to complete your software well before the due date to avoid 
last minute submission problems. You can submit as many times as you like; later submissions overwrite 
any earlier one by that student. If multiple team members submit, the submission that achieves the 
highest grade will be used. 
 
From Jan. 22 onward, you are expected to meet each week with both your TA and CI, and to have a written 
status update on your wiki page (wiki is an easy-to-edit web page). If you cannot be present some week 
for some reason, you should make alternative arrangements with your TA and/or CI in advance.  
 
The screen shot below gives an idea of what a short status report on your wiki might look like. Your status 
reports should give specifics on what each team member did or did not achieve in the past week, and 
what each team member commits to complete in the coming week. A table can be helpful to organize this 
information, as shown below. Documenting your plan and your commitments to each other on the wiki is 
an important part of project management. Part of your milestone 1, 2 and 3 grades will be assigned by 
your TA based on your project management, and your CI will take the clarity of your weekly updates (on 
the wiki and in your meeting) into account in assessing the portion your mark for preparedness, 
professionalism and participation.

Suggestions and Workload: 
To spread the workload of this course, get started on Milestone 0 and Written Document 0 right away. 
Your software deliverables will depend on knowing the tools that you are taught in milestone 0, so make 
sure you go through the entire Milestone 0 handout, as well as the relevant Quick Start guides to learn 
any tools (debugger, git, valgrind) that you are not familiar with.  
To complete Written Document 0 you will need to read the first six chapters of Made to Stick. You will 
also be expected to apply principles from Made to Stick in your written documents and oral presentations 
and be able to answer questions on how you applied the principles. For all these reasons you should read 
Made to Stick as early as possible, and certainly within the first three weeks of the course. 
Later software milestones can leverage some of the code you write for earlier milestones, so creating 
maintainable software that you can keep extending throughout the course will help you. 
By Friday, January 19 you should have formed a group of three, with all three teammates being in the 
same time slot (for both tutorial and labs). Get started on finding teammates right away, and be strategic 
in your choices. You want to choose teammates that: 
 
Have similar work ethics and goals for project quality / grades; 
 
Have complementary skill sets (e.g. an excellent writer plus two strong coders); 
 
Trust each other and work together well on a personal level. 
You will enter your team composition in quercus. Balancing work across the three team members (and 
having a solid contribution from each) is key to having a fun experience and avoiding an excessive 
workload. 
Lecture & Tutorial Material: 
The lecture and tutorial material will help you complete the course milestones, written documents and 
oral presentations. Additionally, you will be asked questions after your presentations, and any material 
covered in the lectures or tutorials and any material in the first six chapters of Made to Stick will be 
assumed background knowledge on which you should be able to answer questions.  
A tentative schedule and topic list for the lectures and tutorials is given below.

Laboratory Computers and Working from Home: 
Your lab assignments will be developed, tested, and submitted from the UG computers. You can access 
the UG machines (e.g. ug150.eecg.utoronto.ca) from your home through your Internet Service Provider 
(ISP). To do so, you must connect to ECE using a secure shell (ssh) and if you want to display graphics, 
through the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) program. For more information on using the ECE lab 
computers remotely, please consult the VNC Quick Start Guide on the course website. 
You can also download a virtual machine that allows you to run a setup very similar to the UG machines 
directly on your home computer. See the Virtual Machine Quick Start Guide on the course website for 
details. A virtual machine allows you to complete most software development without being as 
dependent on the internet, but you will still have to do your final testing and submission on the UG 
machines. 
All program submissions take your code directly from your revision control system (git), and all programs 
will be demonstrated and marked on the lab ECE computers. Code that is not in git cannot be submitted, 
and a program that does not work correctly on the lab computers will be marked as incorrect! Plan 
ahead, and make sure you leave time to integrate your code with your teammates, that it is committed 
into git and has been tested on the UG machines.

Getting Help via the Discussion Board: 
If you have a question outside of your regular lab (TA) or tutorial (CI) time, you can post it to the course 
discussion board; we will use Piazza for the discussion board and there is a link to it on the course website. 
The TAs and course instructors regularly check this board to answer questions and the answers become 
available to all students. Thus, it pays to check the board before posting a question to make sure that the 
question has not been posted and answered earlier.  
You are encouraged to use the discussion board and to engage in discussions about the assignments with 
fellow students on the board. However, do not post significant code as a public post on the discussion 
board or give detailed solutions or algorithms on the discussion board as it may constitute an academic 
offense (see below). If you think your post needs to share significant code, make it a private post so only 
instructors can see it. Also, if the message is to be directed to a specific TA, CI or instructor consider email 
instead of the discussion board. 
Other Help and Guidance: 
When completing a major project like this there will be challenges, and that is part of the learning --  
challenges and setbacks will happen on the real projects you undertake in your career, so gaining 
experience in managing them is important. The teaching team is here to mentor and advise you in any 
way we can. When you’re looking for help or guidance on any part of the course (from questions about 
the course material, through teamwork or project management challenges), or have broader concerns 
about your workload or any other part of your academic experience, please reach out to the teaching 
team. Some options are: 
 
Discuss with your TA or CI in your weekly meeting 
 
Send a private email to your CI or TA, and/or set up a private one-on-one meeting 
 
Discuss with Dr. Betz or Prof. Chong in their weekly coffee hours, or after lecture 
 
Email Prof. Chong or Dr. Betz to ask a private question, or to set up a one-on-one meeting 
Independent Work and Academic Integrity: 
For the university’s academic integrity policy, see https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/. 
 
Students from different teams are encouraged to discuss with one another issues and problems that arise 
during completion of the design project. Such discussions often provide interesting contrasts in design 
choices and can be very valuable learning experiences.  
 
However, work submitted for credit must be the student/team’s own work. It is one thing to discuss and 
compare, but quite another to rely on some other team's work to obtain credit for an assignment. It is 
also an offence to knowingly allow a copy of your work to be submitted by another person/team for credit. 
It is also an offense not to put in place protections to prevent your code from being copied without your 
knowledge. Use of any code written for this course by a student who took the course in a prior year is not 
permitted, whether you obtain that code directly from the prior year student or find it on an open website. 
 
A reasonable rule of thumb to follow during a discussion that crosses teams is that you don’t show the 
other team your code, and nobody leaves the discussion with written notes of what was said. It is unlikely 
that two teams who have discussed only high-level approaches to a problem with no written notes will 
write highly similar programs.


## Page 10

![Page 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qinshirl/SkuleBot/shifang/images/Electrical%20and%20Computer%20Engineering/page_010.png)

All programs submitted for credit in this course will be compared pairwise to identify cases of copying, 
excessive collaboration between teams, and similar offenses. A sophisticated program that is capable of 
detecting similar programs even if considerable effort has been taken to conceal their similarity does the 
comparison. We compare not only submissions from this year, but all prior years.  
 
Any code you use in your program must either be written by your team or come from an open-source 
library. You can use the STL and boost libraries with no reference, but if you use source code from other 
open-source libraries you should add a reference to the library in your comments so it is clear where it 
came from. Use of significant amounts of code (outside of open-source libraries) you find from others 
(e.g. on the web) to implement a milestone is not allowed, and in no circumstances is any code written by 
another team (present or prior years) for this course permitted to be used in your project. If in doubt 
about whether you can use code available in a library or on the web, ask your TA or post a question to the 
instructors on Piazza. 
 
All written reports and oral presentations must similarly be the work of a single team (or a single person, 
in the case of WD0). Reports and presentation files are submitted through Quercus, which is integrated 
with automatic plagiarism detection software. Normally, students will be required to submit their course 
written work to the University’s plagiarism detection tool for a review of textual similarity and detection 
of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their written work to be included as source 
documents in the tool’s reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting 
plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of this tool are described on the Centre for 
Teaching Support & Innovation web site (https://uoft.me/pdt-faq). 
 
Any work submitted for credit that is not the work of the person submitting it will be treated as an offense 
under the Code of Academic Discipline of the University. Similarly, aiding anyone in the submission of 
work that is not the work of the submitter will also be treated as an offense under the Code of Academic 
Discipline of the University. Penalties can range from grade penalties in the course to suspension from the 
University. The Dean, as advised by the instructor and the Departmental Chair, determines the penalty 
for each case. 
 
Policy on generative AI tools:  
Work submitted for credit must be a student’s original and independent work. If an AI tool such as 
ChatGPT or MS Copilot is used to suggest text or code, the affected text, code, or image must be indicated 
by a footnote, comment, or reference acknowledging its use.  AI generated text used directly in written 
assignments must also be indicated by quotation marks. 
 
Use of significant amounts of AI-generated text or code is likely to be flagged as overly similar to other 
student submissions and documents on the web by our plagiarism checkers and such cases will be treated 
as plagiarism, or as failing to demonstrate independent, original work of a student. Failure to acknowledge 
the use of GenAI tools (when they have been used) is also considered an academic offence.  
 
Since there are currently no firmly established standards for acknowledging or referencing GenAI use, 
substantive efforts to acknowledge the use of GenAI will be accepted. A suggested method would be to 
provide (1) a citation or note in the text/code and (2) a reference in works cited using the following format: 
Tool Name, URL, Date used, Description of how it was used, “Prompt(s) used." Because similar prompts 
will generate different responses at different times, you should include a screenshot of the output in an 
appropriately titled appendix*.


## Page 11

![Page 11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qinshirl/SkuleBot/shifang/images/Electrical%20and%20Computer%20Engineering/page_011.png)

Given the fluid nature of GenAI use in university pedagogy, we encourage student engagement on the 
topic; if you have any additional questions about the use of GenAI in your assignments, please contact 
your instructor(s). 
 
*Note: GenAI tools do not carry any inherent authority. Using source material (directly or indirectly) from 
a GenAI tool will not help you to meet one of the central objectives of engineering research and source 
usage, which is to provide authority or to support claims you make. 
 
Notice of video recording and sharing (Download permissible; re-use prohibited): 
At times during this course, some interactions including your participation, may be recorded on video and 
will be available to students in the course for viewing remotely and after each session. 
 
Course videos and materials belong to the instructors, the University, and/or other source depending on 
the specific facts of each situation, and are protected by copyright. In this course, you are permitted to 
download session videos and materials for your own academic use, but you should not copy, share, or use 
them for any other purpose without the explicit permission of the instructor. For questions about 
recording and use of videos in which you appear please contact your instructor. 
 
After the Course: 
Hopefully you will find the course project memorable and will want to add it to your professional list of 
achievements. Many students keep a video of their final map and a copy of their source code so they can 
show them to potential future employers, and the teaching team strongly supports that. 
Posting a video of your project publicly is fine, but posting the source code from this project on a public 
website encourages plagiarism by future students, and reduces their learning by giving them a template 
for how to attack the project. Such public posting violates the copyright on the code provided to you by 
the teaching team and also places you at risk of being drawn into an academic integrity violation if a future 
student copies your work. Therefore, while having a private copy or website of your project source code 
is fine (and encouraged), you should not post your project source code on a public web site.
