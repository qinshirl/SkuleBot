Question 1 [10 marks]
(a) A charged oil droplet with a radius of 1 um and density of 3/(4m) grams per cm can be
held suspended vertically between two parallel, horizonal metal plates when an appropri-
ate electric field is applied between them. The lower and upper plates are negatively and
positively charged, respectively. Compute the charge (magnitude and sign) on the oil
droplet if the magnitude of the electric field required to hold it stationary is 2548.75N/C.
