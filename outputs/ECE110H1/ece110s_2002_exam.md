Answer the following questions.
The mathematical relationship which describes the interaction between stationary charges is
known as
(i) The electric and gravitational forces of attraction between an election and a proton separatec
by a distance r illustrate the significance of the electric force. The relative strength (i.e., the
ratio) of the electric force to the gravitational force (I l/lE cl between an electron and a
proion is (circle the correct answer)

(e)
~ 1039.
(iii) It is recognized that a current carrying conductor creates a magnetic field around itself, and
that a magnetic force is observed between current carrying conductors.
Explain why some materials inherently have a strong magnetic field around themselves
while others have a weak or essentially no magnetic field around themselves.

Question 1: Electricity and Magnetism
PART D: Magnetism
Magnetic field is used to deflect charged particles in a variety of applications. The diagram below
illustrares the deflection of a charged particle beam (particle charge q and velocity i) by a hori-
zontal magnetic field (B which is perpendicular to 1). The magnetic ficid is generated by a pair of
coils; the electrical current in the coils is I. Assume that the electric field is negligible.

current 1? Explain your answer?
If q is positive and the magnetic field direction is as shown, what is the direction of deflec-
tion (i.e., up (positive y) or down (negative y))? Explain your answer.
