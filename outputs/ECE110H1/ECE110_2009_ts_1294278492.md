3. [10 marks] A positively charged particle is moving with a constant velocity v = 2.0x10° m/s j in a uniform
electric field E = 2.0 V/m î. A long current-carrying wire is parallel to the y-axis and is separated from the
charge by 1.0 cm, as shown in the figure below. Find:
(a) The direction of the current in the wire. (2 marks)
(b) The magnitude of the current in the wire. (5 marks)
(c) If the current is reduced by half, in order to maintain the straight trajectory of the charged particle, what
should the velocity of the charged particle be? (3 marks)
