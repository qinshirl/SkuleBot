The magnitude of the field dB produced at point P 
at distance r by a current-length element ds turns 
out to be
where θ is the angle between the directions of ds and ȓ, a 
unit vector that points from ds toward P. Symbol μ0 is a 
constant, called the permeability constant, whose value is 
defined to be exactly
Biot Savart Law
The direction of dB, shown as being into the page in the figure, is that of the cross 
product ds×ȓ. We can therefore write the above equation containing dB in vector form as
This vector equation and its scalar form are known as the law of Biot and Savart.

Ampere’s Law

• Ienc is the current enclosed by the Amperian Loop
• Q: Inside a long metallic conductor, carrying a current I, where is the 
magnetic field B = 0

Ampere’s law states that
The line integral in this equation is evaluated around a 
closed loop called an Amperian loop. The current i on the 
right side is the net current encircled by the loop.
Ampere’s Law
Ampere’s law applied to an 
arbitrary Amperian loop that 
encircles two long straight wires 
but excludes a third wire. Note the 
directions of the currents.
A right-hand rule for 
Ampere’s law, to 
determine the signs for 
currents encircled by an 
Amperian loop.

Thévenin’s and Norton’s
• Remove the load and find the open circuit voltage of the circuit
• To determine the RTH depends on the circuit
• Only independent sources. Replace voltage sources with short circuits and 
current sources with open circuits
• Only Dependent sources. Connect an independent current or voltage source 
to the terminals an calculate the voltage or current. Use Ohm’s Law to 
calculate RRH
• Both Dependent and Independent sources. Short circuit the output terminals 
and calculate isc. Use this with voc to calculate RTH.
• For Norton’s start with isc

AC circuits
• Express voltages, and currents as Phasors
• 𝐼= 𝐼𝑚∠Θ𝐼
• 𝑉= 𝑉𝑚∠Θ𝑣
• Impedance is a complex number which depends on w
• 𝑍= 𝑍𝑚∠Θ𝑧=R+jX(w)
• For simple circuits use Ohm’s law
• Apply KVL, KCL, superposition etc
• Thevenin’s, Norton’s etc

IMPEDANCE AND ADMITTANCE
For each of the passive components the relationship between the voltage phasor 
and the current phasor is algebraic. We now generalize for an arbitrary 2-terminal
element.
