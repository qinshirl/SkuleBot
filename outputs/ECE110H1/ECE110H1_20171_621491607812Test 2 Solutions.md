Q2 [10 marks]
Consider the following system that consists of two independent circuits that are electromagnetically
coupled through a pair of coils (one located within the other). All elements of this system lie flat with
respect to the paper.
R
Hoop
Outer Coil
RIGHT
Bout
Inner Coil
(a) [3 marks] The first circuit consists of a single circular loop connected in series with the outer coil.
Let's say the south pole of a magnet, which was initially located far away above the paper, is moved
towards but not through the conductive loop. Which of the following statements must be true?
(Hoop = current induced in the loop; Bout = magnetic field induced through the outer coil
Hoop = clockwise, Bour = right-to-left
Toop = counter-clockwise, Bout = right-to-left
Hoop = clockwise, Bou = left-to-right
Iloop = counter-clockwise, Bout = left-to-right
Answer:
Consider the case where the magnet shown in the diagram above, is displaced such that it induces a time
dependent current, Loop(t) = 6.5t Amperes, where t = time, through the outer coil (length = 10 cm, 500
turns). This current is electromagnetically coupled to the inner coil (40 turns, cross-sectional area = 2
cm*), which results in a peak power dissipated at the resistor, R = 2 kS.
(b) [3 marks] Calculate the magnetic field in the outer coil:
B= 4.08x10°tT
