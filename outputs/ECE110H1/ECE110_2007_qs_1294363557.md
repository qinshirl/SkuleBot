Instructions: Non-programmable calculators allowed. No other aids. Answer in the space
provided on these sheets. The back sides of these sheets can be used as well. For full marks (20)
you must show methods, state UNITS and compute numerical answers when requested. Please
write in PEN, not pencil.
1. [10 marks] Consider the circuit shown below. The switch has been in position A for a
long time when it is changed to position B at time t=0.
(a) Find the initial (t=0) and final condition (t=00) for the capacitor voltage, V (t). (2 marks)
(b) Find the time constant t, for t2O. (2 marks)
(c) Determine voltage V (t) for all 20. (4 marks)
