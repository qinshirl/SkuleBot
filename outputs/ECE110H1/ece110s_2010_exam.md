Question 1: [10 marks]
Insert the correct answer in the box associated with each of the following:
(a) (2 marks) Gauss's law $ E • dA = - implies that:
(i) E must be the electric field due to the enclosed charge.
(i) If q = 0, then E= O everywhere on the Gaussian surface.
(iii) If the three particles enclosed by the Gaussian surface have charges of
+9, +q, and - 2q, then the integral is zero.
(iv) On the surface E is everywhere parallel to dA
(v) If a charge is placed outside the Gaussian surface, then it cannot affect
E at any point on the surface.
(b) (2 marks) Choose the correct statement:
(i) A proton tends to go from a region of low electrostatic potential to a
region of high electrostatic potential.
(i) The electrostatic potential of a negatively charged conductor must be
(iii) If E is zero at a point P, then V must be zero at P.
(iv) If V = 0 at a point P, then E must be zero at P.
(v) None of the above is correct.
(c) (2 marks) Capacitors C, and C2 are connected in parallel and a potential
lifference is applied to the combination. If the capacitor that is equivalen

(iii) The difference of the charges on C1 and Cz.
(iv) The product of the charges on Cy and C2.
(v) None of the above.
(d) (2 marks) Two parallel long wires carry the same current and repel each
other with a force F per unit length. If both these currents are doubled and
the wire separation tripled, the force per unit length becomes:

(iii) 2F/3
(iv) 4F/3
(v) 6F
(e) (2 marks) A rectangular loop of wire is placed midway between two long
straight parallel conductors as shown in Figure le. The reference direction
for currents i, and iz are as indicated in Fig. Ie. If i, is increasing and iz is
constant, then the induced current in the loop is:
(i) Zero.
(ii) Clockwise.
(iii) Counterclockwise.
(iv) Depends on i, - iz.
(v) Depends on i, + iz.

Question 3: (10 marks]
A large field coil is driven by a sinusoidal voltage of 100 kHz with an amplitude of 5V, and can
be treated as an ideal solenoid. A small test coil is inserted into the center of the field coil and
has negligible effect on the field coil. An induced emf is measured on the test coil.

turns N, = 500; Radius of the copper wire, r = 1.0 mm; Resistivity of copper at room
temperature, p= 1.72×108 Sm.
The test coil parameters are: Coil radius r, = 1.3 cm; Coil length l, = 16 cm; Total turns N, =160.
