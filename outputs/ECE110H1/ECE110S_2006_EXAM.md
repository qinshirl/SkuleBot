Question 1 - Electricity and Magnetism
Page 3 of 11
Two point charges, +Q and -Q, are placed in a region of space where the magnetic field B is
uniform and points in the -Z direction. The charges are moving in parallel in the a direction with
speed v. The distance between the point charges is r, as shown in Figure 1B. Find the expression
of the speed v, for which the distance r between the charges is not changing in time.
