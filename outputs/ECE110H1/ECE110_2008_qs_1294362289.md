Instructions: Non-programmable calculators allowed. No other aids. Answer in the
space provided on these sheets. The back sides of these sheets can be used as well. For
full marks you must show methods, state UNITS and compule numcrical answers when
requested. Please write in PEN, not pencil.
Note: Î= i. I=y. =î are the unit vectors in the x. y, 2., direction respectively.
1. Electrostatics [10 marks]
A capacitor consists of two parallel plates of area A=5 cm? at a distance d=3 cm from
each other. Between the plates, there is a uniform electric field E=-5jV/m.
(a) Calculate the potential difference AV between the plates. Clearly indicate which plate
is positively and which is negatively charged.
[3 marks]
(b) For the points A, B, C indicated, determine whether: V. - V.. Va- Ve, V, - V, are
positive, negative or zero.

2. Magnetostatics |10 marks]
Consider the system of three infinite, thin, wires parallel to the y-axis, carrying currents
1=2 A, l2=l A, and 1y=2 A, respectively.
(a) Lel a represent the distance between wires 1, 2 and let b represent the distance
hetween wires 2, 3. Calculate the ratio h/a such that no net force is experieneed by the
first wire. Clearly indicate the corresponding direction of the current Is

(b) Assuming that la is removed from the system, derive an expression for the nel
magnetic field (magnitude and direction) produced by wires 1, 2 at two points Pi (x), yI)
and P2(x2, y2) on the x-y plane (shown in the figure), as a function of their coordinates
