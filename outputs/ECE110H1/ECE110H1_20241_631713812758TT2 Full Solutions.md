Term Test 2 - March 12, 2024
1:10 - 2:40 p.m. (1.5 hours)
(e = 1.6 x10-19 C, 8o = 8.85 x10-12 F/m, Mo = 4xx 10-7 H/m, g = 9.8 m/s?)
Instructions:
1. Exam Type C3: a one-page (8.5" × 11") double-sided aid sheet is allowed. This aid
sheet may be handwritten or computer-generated, including typewritten text,
images, or other formats that fit within the paper. Using the template from FASE's
website is not mandatory.
2. Non-programmable calculators (e.g., Casio FX-991MS & Sharp EL-520X) are
permitted.
3. Please use a dark pen or pencil and ensure your handwriting is clear, as the paper
will be scanned for grading.
4. For full marks, you must show methods, state UNITS, and compute numerical
answers when requested.
5. An extra blank page is provided at the end. If you use this page for your answers,
make sure to clearly indicate this within the relevant question area to ensure it is
considered during the grading process.
6. TAs and instructors CANNOT answer inquiries regarding the exam questions. If
you are unsure about the question, please state your assumptions in your answer.

Q1. Consider an infinitely long wire consisting of two concentric components. An inner
solid cylinder with radius r1 = 1 [cm], and a hollow cylindrical shell with an outer radius
of r2 = 3 [cm]. The current density within each component is defined by (1) Jcylinder =
250 mżl (positive x-direction) and (2) shell = 500 [m2| (negative x-direction). Assume
an infinitesimally thin insulating layer between the two components of the wire.
Insulating layer
a) Determine the radius within the wire where the magnetic field is zero [3 marks].

b) The infinitely long wire is then positioned above a uniform magnetic field (B =
3.5 × 10- [T]), which is defined within the rectangular area (W = 3 [m], h = 1 [m]). The
direction of the magnetic field is pointing out of the plane (positive z-direction). Calculate
the magnitude and direction of the magnetic force exerted on the wire. [4 marks].

c) Consider a system where 2 parallel wires are located above the uniform magnetic field
(B = 3.5 × x10-' [T]), rectangular area (w = 3 [m], h = 1 [m]), where wire 2 is fixed in
place and both wires are separated by a distance (d = 40 [cm]). If the current flowing
through wire 1 is 0.2 [A] (positive x-direction), what current is needed in wire 2 to prevent
the first wire from moving? (3 marks]

Q2. A conductive U-shaped railing is placed in the x-y plane as shown below. A movable
metal rod (touching the railing) is initially located parallel to the y-axis at x = 0 [m]. At
t = 0 [s], the metal rod starts to move in the positive x-direction with a constant speed, u
[m/s]. A infinite long straight wire carrying a current, i(t) = 2t [A] lies parallel to the x-
axis at y = - L [m].
