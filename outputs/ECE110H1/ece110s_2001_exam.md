Question 1:  Electricity and Magnetism
PART A:  General
Answer the following questions.
[1]
(i)
Electric and magnetic phenomena stem from a property of matter known as charge. What is 
the distinguishing condition of charges that gives rise to a magnetic ﬁeld?
[1]
(ii)
The electric ﬁeld is a conservative ﬁeld. Explain this property of the electric ﬁeld.
 
[1]
(iii) When we speak of electrical current, the picture that comes to mind is that of electrons drift-
ing down a copper wire. The average velocity or the drift velocity of electrons required to 
support a current of 1 ampere in a copper wire of 1 mm2 in cross-section is about (circle the 
correct answer)
(a)
1000 km/s
(b)

(c)

(d)
none of the above.

(iv)
The Lorentz force is used, for example, to steer electrons in a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a 
television tube. Clearly write the Lorentz force expression and deﬁne all the terms.

Question 4:  AC Circuits
A 1000 watt electric motor is connected to a source of 120 Vrms at 60 Hz, which results in a lagging 
power factor (PF) of 0.8. (Note: lagging power factor means the current in the motor lags the 
voltage across the motor.)
