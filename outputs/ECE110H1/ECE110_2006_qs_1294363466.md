Instructions: Non-programmable calculators allowed. No other aids. Answer in the space
provided on these sheets. The back sides of these sheets can be used as well. For full marks you
must show methods, state UNITS and compute numerical answers when requested. Please write
in PEN, not pencil.
Electrostatics. Two 2 nC point charges qi and qz are located in a Cartesian coordinate
system at (0,4 cm,0) and (0,-4 cm,0), respectively, as shown below.
(a) Calculate the electric field E (magnitude and direction) at point P, with coordinates
(b) Which point charge O would have to be placed at point P2 with coordinates (0,4 cm,0)
such that its electric field at point P, cancels the electric field due to gi and qz?
(3 marks)
(c) Calculate the electrostatic force Eer on O. (2 marks)
(d) If charge Q is to be moved from (4 cm, 0,0) to (8 cm,0,0), is there work to be done by ar
external force? Explain your answer. No further calculation required. (1 mark)

Magnetic Field. At all points on the y-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system the magnetic
field has a magnitude of 2 uT and the direction shown below. An infinitely long wire
carrying a current of 15 A is located along the y-axis.
(a) Calculate the force per unit length on the wire. (3 marks)
(b) Assume the magnetic field is due to a second, parallel wire, also carrying a current of
15 A. Consider only the magnitude of B on the y-axis and determine its distance from
the first wire. (4 marks)
(c) Find the location of the second wire in order to produce both the magnitude and
direction of B on the y-axis. (2 marks)
(d) Is there more than one possible answer to part (c)? Explain. (1 mark)
B=2uT
\=15 A
