Q1) Consider the following circuit (A-B-C-D) that consists of a voltage source V(t) and a
resistor (Ri). The segment of wire connecting nodes A and B overlaps with a uniform magnetic
field (B = 2,5 mT) pointing into the x-y plane. The B field is confined within the square area,
where a = 30 cm.

semi-circle in the x-y plane, with a diameter of b = 40 cm. There is a single wire loop (area =
0.01 m) placed at the center of the semi-circle and connected to a second resistor (R).
