Question 1 - Electricity and Magnetism
Part A
The device shown in Fig. 1A is called a velocity selector and its operation is as follows: Charges
q launched into the chamber from its left aperture with velocity & = vi, should be able to exit the
chamber from its right aperture, moving along a linear trajectory, only if v = vo.
If the electric field in the chamber is E = —Eo j, determine the magnetic field (magnitude in
terms of Eo, vo, q and direction) needed for the device to operate as described above. (4 marks]

i) Determine whether there is an induced current in the loop and show the direction of that
current, if the loop moves with a constant velocity in the:
• +x direction;

ii) Assume that the magnetic field produced by the wire is almost constant throughout the loop
area and equal to its value at the center of the loop. Find the current I of the vertical wire
if the loop current is Loop =1 MA at (x=0.25 m, y=0), when the loop moves with a constant
velocity = 10 m/sec î. [4 marks]
