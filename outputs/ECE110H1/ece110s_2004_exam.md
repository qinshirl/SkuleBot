A strain gauge is used to measure the amount of mechanical stress on an object. The
gauge is composed of a wire such that when stretched the wire's length increases and the
width narrows, thus increasing the resistance. The circuit below is used to measure the
amount of stress applied to the strain gauge (variable resistor R). The voltage is read using a
voltmeter (V) between terminals A and B. Resistances Rw/, Rw2, and Rw3 are wire resis-
tances.
Use voltage division to find the output voltage V = VA - V. Express V in terms of the
circuit elements (Vs, R,, Rwl, Rw2, Rw3, Ros and R).
