Q2 [10 marks] The following circuit consists of two parts that are magnetically coupled between: (Part A) a
solenoid (10,000 turns, radius of 4.5 cm, and length of 20 cm) connected to time-varying current source (Is)
and (Part B) a coil (750 turns, radius of 4 cm) placed within the center of the solenoid. The coil is connected to
a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) in series. Assume all circuit elements are ideal.
