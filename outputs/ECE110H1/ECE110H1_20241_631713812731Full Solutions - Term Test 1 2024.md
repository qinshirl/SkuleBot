7:10 - 8:40 p.m. (1.5 hours)
(e = 1.6 x10-19 C, 8o = 8.85 ×10-12 F/m, Mo = 4mx10-7 H/m, g = 9.8 m/s?)
Instructions:
1. Exam Type C3: a one-page (8.5" × 11") double-sided aid sheet is allowed. This aid
sheet may be handwritten or computer-generated, including typewritten text,
images, or other formats that fit within the paper. Using the template from FASE's
website is not mandatory.
2. Non-programmable calculators (Casio FX-991MS & Sharp EL-520X) are
permitted.
3. Please use a dark pen or pencil and ensure your handwriting is clear, as the paper
will be scanned for grading.
4. For full marks, you must show methods, state UNITS, and compute numerical
answers when requested.
5. An extra blank page is provided at the end. If you use this page for your answers,
make sure to clearly indicate this within the relevant question area to ensure it is
considered during the grading process.
6. TAs and instructors CANNOT answer inquiries regarding the exam questions. If
you are unsure about the question, please state your assumptions in your answer.

Q2. Consider a stationary non-conducting spherical shell, with a radius of 1 m that has a
negative charge uniformly distributed on its surface. As shown in the figure, a negatively
charged particle with a charge 91= -5 × 10-8 C and a mass of 5x10-6 kg is
suspended by a thin insulating thread that is 1 m in length. The angle 0 between the thread
and the vertical axis is 30°. The origin of the coordinate system is set at the center of the
spherical shell. An infinitely large uniformly charged non-conducting sheet is positioned
3 m away from the origin (x = 3 m) in parallel with the y-z plane (shown in cross-section
in the figure below). Assume gravitational acceleration is 9.8m/s?
