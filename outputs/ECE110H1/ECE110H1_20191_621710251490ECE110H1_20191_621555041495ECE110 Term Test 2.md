Q1 [10 marks]
Figure shows a metallic wire loop in the shape of an equilateral triangle (all sides are equal
having the length a centimeter) immersed in a magnetic field B. The magnetic field (B) is
uniform in space, pointing into the page, but changes with time according to tet (T).
Considering the time interval 0 < t < 1 second, answer the following questions.
a) Derive an expression for the magnitude of the * B • * •
induced current in terms of a and t, assuming each
Side of the triangle has a resistance R (S2). What is *
the direction of the induced current (clockwise or
counter clockwise)? (6 marks)
* *8

b) Obtain an expression for the total power dissipated in the metallic loop. Show all your work
and simplify your answer as much as possible. (2 marks)
c) Suppose that each side of the triangle is doubled in length, while the loop is still entirely
immersed in the magnetic field. As compared to the part (a), does the induced current increase or
decrease and by how much? Show all your work. (2 marks)
