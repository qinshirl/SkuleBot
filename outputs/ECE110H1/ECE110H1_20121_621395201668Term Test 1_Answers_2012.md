1. [10 marks] Consider two parallel, infinite non-conducting thin sheets of charge which have uniform 
surface charge densities of +2σ and –σ separated by a distance L. A cylindrical Gaussian surface with radius 
r, extending a distance L on either side is constructed around the planes as shown in the figure.

surface? [2 marks]

An infinite non-conducting thin line of charge which has a uniform line charge density of +λ, is positioned 
perpendicularly to the planar sheets of charge and aligned with the central axis of the cylindrical Gaussian 
surface, as shown in the picture below. Neglect the effects of the intersection of the wire with the sheets.  
 
(c)  What is the net flux through the Gaussian surface?

2. [10 marks] A cylindrical capacitor consisting of two coaxial cylinders of radius a and b (b>a) and length 
(L) where L>>b is shown in the Figure below. The inner shell has a total charge of +Q and the outer shell 
has a total charge of -Q. Fringing may be neglected.

3. [10 marks] Three thin long wires are positioned in the form of an equilateral triangle with current I0 (I0 is 
positive) as shown below. There is no electric contact between the wires where they intersect each other and 
you can assume the wires are infinitely long.  
 
a) What is the magnetic field (𝐵ሬ⃗) direction and magnitude at the point o? [6 marks] 
 
b) Initially an electron is moving along the positive x-axis at the point o. Does the trajectory of the electron 
change as the result of the magnetic field at o? If yes, in which direction will the electron be deflected?

c) Now consider another electron moving initially along the positive z-axis at the point o. Does the magnetic 
field (𝐵ሬ⃗) do work on the electron? Justify your answer. [2 marks]
