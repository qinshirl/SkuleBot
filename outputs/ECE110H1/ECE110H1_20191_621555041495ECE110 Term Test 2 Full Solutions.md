Q1 |10 marks]
Figure shows a metallic wire loop in the shape of an equilateral triangle (all sides are equal
having the length a centimeter) immersed in a magnetic field B. The magnetic field (B) is
uniform in space, pointing into the page, but changes with time according to te t (T).
Considering the time interval 0 < t < 1 second, answer the following questions.
a) Derive an expression for the magnitude of the B @
induced current in terms of a and t, assuming each
side of the triangle has a resistance R (S2). What is
the direction of the induced current (clockwise or
counter clockwise)? (6 marks)
