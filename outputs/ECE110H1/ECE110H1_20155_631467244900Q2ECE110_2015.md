Following figure shows a parallel-plate capacitor with an area of A = 0.12m2 and a separation of 
d = 1.2cm. The capacitor is charged to a voltage of 120V by a battery and then the battery is 
disconnected. After charging the capacitor a dielectric slab of thickness b = 4mm with a 
dielectric constant of қ = 4.8 is inserted symmetrically between the plates as shown. 
Determine: 
a) Capacitance before the slab was inserted. [1 Mark] 
b) Capacitance with the slab in place. [1 Mark] 
c) Total charge before and after the slab is inserted. [1.5 Marks] 
d) Potential difference across this capacitor. [1.5 Marks]
