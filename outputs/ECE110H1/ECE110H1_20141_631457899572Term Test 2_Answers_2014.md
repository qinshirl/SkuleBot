Q1 [10 marks] Consider the co-axial cable shown in the figure below. The currents in the central region and
the outer shell are equal in magnitude and flowing in opposite directions. Assume that the current is
uniformly distributed across each region.
a = 1 cm
b = 3 cm
c = 4 cm
i= 200 mA
(a) Calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at the surface of the inner conductor. (2 marks)
