Question 1: Electricity and Magnetism
PART E: Magnetic Induction
A magnetic field, uniform in space but varying linearly with time, is represented by the relation
[B(1)| = a 1, where a [T s'] is the rate of change of the magnetic field with respect to time, / is time in sec-
onds, and [B(1)| is the magnetic field in tesla. A circular loop of radius 5 cm is immersed in this magnetic
field. The loop has a small gap in it, the ends of which are connected to a resistor.

Question 3: Transient Analysis
PART B
The circuit on the right shows a
12V battery being used to establish
a current through an inductor. This
current is then used to generate a
voltage of sufficient magnitude to
cause breakdown of the atmosphere
(for example, vapourized gasoline-
air mixture) in the spark-plug gap.
The spark plug gap can be mod-
elled by a 50k resistor until the
moment when breakdown occurs.

(ii)
To ensure that breakdown occurs, it is desired that the required high voltage remain present for at
least 5 ms. It is estimated that 75% of the initial voltage is sufficient to cause breakdown. Assum-
ing that the spark plug gap resistance does not change, what is the magnitude of the inductance
which will ensure that this design requirement is satisfied? Is this the minimum or maximum
value?

(iii)
Assume that after repeated switching, a resistive coating forms only on switch contact b. This coat-
ing may be represented by a resistor.
What is the magnitude of this resistor which will cause the
circuit to fail? (Failure, in this case, constitutes not producing the required voltage for breakdown,
as defined above.)
