Q1 [10 marks]
• Consider two infinitely long concentric cylindrical conductors as shown in the
figure, and having radii "" of 2cm and 6cm, respectively.
• The inner cylinder has a positive charge and the outer cylindrical shell has a
negative charge equal in magnitude to that of the inner cylinder.
• The magnitude of the electric field in the space halfway (r=4cm) between the
two concentric cylinders is 9.94x10° N/C.
(a) What is the surface charge density on the inner cylinder? (3 marks)
0=1.76x104C/mz
(b) Compute the flux through a cylindrical surface of length 10cm on the inner cylinder. (2 marks)
(c) Compute the total flux through the outer surface of the cylindrical shell. (2 marks)
§ =0
(d) What is the potential difference between the two concentric cylinders? (3 marks)
AV= 4.37×105 V

Q2 [10 marks] A Van de Graaff generator consists of a large, hollow metal sphere, with an outer diameter of
30 cm. It is far away from ground and other charged sources. Charge is put onto the generator at a constant
rate of 1nC/second.
(a) What is the capacitance of the Van de Graaff generator? (6 marks)
(b) How long does it take to charge it to 100 kV? (2 marks)
(c) How much energy is stored by charging the generator from 0 to 100 kV? (2 marks)
Hint: Consider the Van de Graaff generator as a capacitor with only one conducting sphere, implying the
other conducting sphere is at infinity.
(a) C = 16,65 PF
(b) 1665 second
(c) 4 = 83,5 mJ
