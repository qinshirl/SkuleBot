C) Let's consider the case where if current passing through any resistor exceeds 7.5 mA, the resistivity
begins to change permanently. We can characterize this relationship as P(1) = p. (1 + kt?). [po is
the resistivity below 7.5 mA, k=1/4 s° and t is time in seconds] Determine the total resistance seen by
the current source in 2 seconds. (4 marks)
