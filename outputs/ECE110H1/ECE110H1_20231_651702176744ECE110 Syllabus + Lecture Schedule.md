Discussion Board (Piazza) 
 
We will use Piazza for the class discussion board. Piazza is connected through Quercus.  For 
information on joining the Piazza site for this course, please see the document Piazza‐  Quercus 
Student Experience.pdf , under the “Course Information” module. 
Please post all your course-related questions to Piazza as it is quite likely others will have the 
same question and it is good to have the responses available to everyone. If you have a personal 
issue, please contact one of the instructors directly.

Hours: 38.4L/38.4P 
An overview of the physics of electricity and magnetism: Coulomb’s law, Gauss’ law, Ampere’s 
law, Faraday’s law, Lenz’s law, and Ohm’s law. Physics of capacitors, resistors, and inductors. 
An introduction to circuit analysis: resistive circuits, nodal and mesh analysis, linearity and 
superposition, Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems, maximum power transfer, first-order RC and 
RL transient response, and sinusoidal steady-state analysis. 
 
4 Learning Outcomes 
 
Learn the laws govern the behaviors of electric charges, and interactions between charges.  
Understand the concepts of electric fields, electric potentials and electric potential energies. 
 
Learn about electrical energy storing elements, such as capacitors, and then use them in various 
electrical circuits.  
Learn about magnetism, magnetic forces on moving electric charges and on current carrying 
wires. Learn about the concept of magnetic fields, magnetic energy, and magnetic energy storing 
devices such as inductors. Understand how inductors behave in electrical circuits.  
Learn about basic circuit elements such as power supply, resistor, capacitor and inductor. Learn 
how to analyze resistive circuits under DC excitation. Learn about various circuit analysis 
techniques: Kirchhoff’s law, current/voltage division rules, nodal/mesh analysis, and 
superposition principles. 
Learn the roles of a capacitor and an inductor in RC and RL transient circuits respectively, and 
the step-by-step technique in analyzing first-order transient circuits. 
Learn about the concepts of phasors and impedances, and use them to analyze sinusoidal steady-
state (AC) circuits. 
Learn about Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems and their significance in circuit analysis. Apply 
Thevenin/Norton theorems and maximum power transfer theorem to resistive networks (DC) 
and sinusoidal steady-state (AC) circuits.

5 Real-World Relevance 
 
Electric charges are everywhere in our physical world and electromagnetic energy powers our 
modern existence. The materials covered in this course teach you something about the 
fundamental particles (electric charges) that are ubiquitous in our world and their awesome 
power that we cannot live without.

Students can interact with the TA during the session to discuss problems in the assignments. The 
tutorials will start in the second week of the semester (week of January 16, 2021). You can see the 
file Tutorial Schedule.pdf under the “Course Information” module for more details.  
The labs are important part of this course and is where you gain hands-on experience using 
electronic instruments, building and testing circuits.

Land Acknowledgement 
 
I (we) wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands 
of years, it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the 
Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous 
people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

Inclusivity, Accommodations and Mental Health Support 
 
14.1  Statement on Inclusivity 
 
You belong here. The University of Toronto commits to all students, faculty and staff that you can 
learn, work and create in a welcoming, respectful and inclusive environment. In this class, we 
embrace the broadest range of people and encourage their diverse perspectives. This team 
environment is how we will innovate and improve our collective academic success. You can read 
the evidence for this approach here. 
We  expect each of us to take responsibility for the impact that our language, actions and interactions 
have on others. Engineering denounces discrimination, harassment and unwelcoming behaviour in 
all its forms. You have rights under the Ontario Human Rights Code. If you experience or witness 
any form of harassment or discrimination, including but not limited to, acts of racism, sexism, 
Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism and ageism, please tell someone 
so we can intervene. Engineering takes these reports extremely seriously. You can talk to anyone you 
feel comfortable approaching, including your professor or TA, an academic advisor, our Assistant 
Dean, Diversity, Inclusion and Professionalism, the Engineering Equity Diversity and Inclusion 
Action Group, any staff member or a U of T Equity Office. 
You are not alone. Here you can find a list of clubs and groups that support people who identify 
in many diverse ways. Working together, we can all achieve our full potential. 
 
 
14.2 Statement on Accommodations 
 
The University of Toronto supports accommodations for students with diverse learning needs, which 
may be associated with mental health conditions, learning disabilities, autism spectrum, ADHD, 
mobility impairments, functional/fine motor impairments, concussion or head injury, blindness 
and low vision, chronic health conditions, addictions, deafness and hearing loss, communication 
disorders and/or temporary disabilities, such as fractures and severe sprains, or recovery from an 
operation. 
If you have a learning need requiring an accommodation, the University of Toronto recommends 
that students register as soon as possible with Accessibility Services. 
Phone: 416-978-8060

Email: accessibility.services@utoronto.ca 
 
In this course, we do not have makeup assignments or tests. However, if you missed some 
assigned tasks, some considerations may be given, as described below. It is very important to 
note that these considerations will be applicable if and only if there are legitimate reasons (e.g. 
sickness, car accident,…). Student must submit the required online petition with the 
supporting documents to the First-Year Office. 
 
14.2.1 Missing Assignments: 
There are seven assignments in this course. All assignments run over many days. If you missed 
no more than four assignments, we will use the marks of the remaining assignments to calculate 
your overall assignment grade. If you missed five assignments, we will use the marks of the 
remaining two assignments minus 20% to calculate your overall assignment grade. If you missed 
six assignments, we will use the marks of the remaining assignment minus 30% to calculate your 
overall assignment grade. If you missed all seven assignments, you will receive zero for the 
assignment grade. 
 
14.2.2 Missing Term Tests: 
There are two term tests in this course. If you missed one term test, we will use your final 
assessment mark to calculate your marks for the missed term test. You must keep in mind that 
the final assessment is cumulative (it includes all the materials covered in the course) and more 
substantial than the term tests. If you missed both term tests, your Final Assessment will be 
worth 60% and you will be given an oral test worth 25% of the course grade. 
 
Important Notice: In the case of unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances such as long-term 
hospitalization, chronical heath issues or similar difficulties, which causes you to miss many of 
the course assignments and tests, please contact your course instructor and the course 
coordinator as soon as possible to discuss your situation and possible available options. 
 
 
14.3 Statement on Mental Health 
 
As a university student, you may experience a range of health and/or mental health challenges that 
could result in significant barriers to achieving your personal and academic goals. Please note, the 
University of Toronto and the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering offer a wide range of free 
and confidential services that could assist you during these times. 
As a U of T Engineering student, you have an Academic Advisor (undergraduate students) or a 
Graduate Administrator (graduate students) who can support you by advising on personal matters 
that impact your academics. Other resources that you may find helpful are listed on the U of T 
Engineering Mental Health & Wellness webpage, and a small selection are also included here: 
 
14.3.1 Accessibility Services & the On-Location Advisor 
14.3.2 Graduate Engineering Council of Students’ Mental Wellness Commission 
14.3.3 Health & Wellness and the On-Location Health & Wellness Engineering Counsellor
