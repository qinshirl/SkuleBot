The figure above shows a single metallic loop of constant area A, immersed inside a uniform magnetic field
B (device is actually a generator). The angle between the loop and magnetic field changes with time
according to cos wt where w is a constant known as angular frequency [rad/s] and / is time [s].

Consider the following two examples above in which we can magnetically induce currents through a simple
resistive circuit. In both cases, the induced current is measured by an ammeter connected in series within
each respective resistive circuit. We assume that the ammeter does not affect any of the circuits.
• In example A, a square coil (10 cm x 10 cm) is pulled through a uniform magnetic field (2.5 T,
directed into page) at a constant velocity, Vcoil = 5 m/s.
• In example B, there is an inner coil centered within an outer solenoid. The outer solenoid has 10,000
turns, radius of 4.5 cm, and length of 20 cm; whereas the inner coil has 40 turns and a diameter of 1.2
cm.
