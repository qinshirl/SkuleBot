1) The loop is pushed upiard.
2) The loop is pushed downward.
3) The loop is pulled to the left, into the magnetic field.
4) The loop is pushed to the right, out of the magnetic field.
5) The tension in the wires increases but the loop does not move.
ii) The magnetic field in Figure 1.3 decreases from 1.0 T to 0.4 T in 1.2 s. A 6 cm diameter
conducting loop with a resistance of 0.01 S is placed perpendicular to B as shown. What are
the magnitude and the direction (cw or cew) of the current induced in the loop during the
1.2 s time interval?
