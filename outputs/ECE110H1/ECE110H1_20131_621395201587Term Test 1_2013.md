• Consider two concentric conductors, an inner sphere of radius 2 cm 
and an outer spherical shell of radius 6 cm as shown in the figure. 
   
• The inner sphere has a positive charge and the outer spherical shell 
has a negative charge equal in magnitude to that of the inner sphere. 
  
• The magnitude of the electric field is 9.94x106 N/C at r = 4 cm in 
the space halfway between the two concentric conductors.
