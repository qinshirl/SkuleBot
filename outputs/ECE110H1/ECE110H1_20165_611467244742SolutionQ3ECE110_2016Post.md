Q2 [7 Marks] Consider a very long straight wire carrying current i in the direction of x-axis as 
shown in the Figure below. At time t=0 the current in this wire is increased from 
i=1A to i=21A in 20 µsec. 
A rectangular loop of wire of width x=1m and length y=2m is located at distance 
s=1m from the current carrying wire.  
a) Derive a relation for the magnetic flux in terms of i, x, y, and s.   
b) Determine the magnitude of the induced emf in the loop of wire while current 
changing. 
c) Indicate the direction of induced current in the loop of wire. Justify.
