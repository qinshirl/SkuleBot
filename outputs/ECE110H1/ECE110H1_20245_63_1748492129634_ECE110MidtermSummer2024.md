Question 1 [7 Marks] 
Four charges are located at the corners of a square of side a=2 m as shown in the Figure below.  If 
Q1= Q2= Q3 =10 µC and Q4 = -10 µC. 
a) Find the magnitude of the electric field at the center of the square, at point (0, 0). Clearly 
show the direction of the electric field on the diagram. 
b) If a test charge Q=2 µC is placed at the square center, point (0, 0), find the magnitude of the 
electric force on this test charge due the other four charges.

Question 3: [6 Marks] 
A cylindrical capacitor consisting of two coaxial cylinders of radius a and b (b>a) and length 
(L) where L>>b is shown in the Figure below. The inner shell has a total charge of +Q and 
the outer shell has a total charge of -Q. Fringing may be neglected. 
Develop a relationship for capacitance of this device in terms of a, b, and L.
