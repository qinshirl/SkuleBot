Question 6 (10 marks)
Page 7 of 11
A linear circuit is driven by an independent voltage source (Vs) and an independent current
source (Is). When the current source is turned off while the voltage source is set to 10V, the output
voltage is at 3.5V. When the current source is set to 1A while the voltage source remains at 10V,
the output voltage is now at 0.5V. Express the output voltage in turns of the voltage source (Vs)
and the current source (Is).
