Question 1: Electricity and Magnetism
PART A: General
Answer the following questions.
Electric and magnetic phenomena stem from a property of matter known as charge. What is
the distinguishing condition of charges that gives rise to a magnetic field?
(ii) The electric ficid is a conservative field. Explain this property of the electric field.
(ii) When we speak of electrical current, the picture that comes to mind is that of electrons drift-
ing down a copper wire. The average velocity or the drift velocity of electrons required to
support a current of 1 ampere in a copper wire of 1 mm? in cross-section is abcut (circle the
correct answer)
(a)
1000 km/s
(b) 3 x 108 m/s
(c)
1/3 m/h
(d)
none of the above
(iv) The Lorentz force is used, for example. to sieer electrons in a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a
television tube. Clearly write the Lorentz force expression and define all the terms.

Question 4: AC Circuits
A 1000 watt electric moror is connected to a source of 120 Vms at 60 Hz. which results in a lagging
power factor (PF) of 0.8. (Note: lagging power factor means the current in the motor lags the
voltage across the moror.)
