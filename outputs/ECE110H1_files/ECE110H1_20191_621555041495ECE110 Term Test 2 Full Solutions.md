Figure shows a metallic wire loop in the Shal* oran equilateral triangle (all sides are equal
having the length a centimeter) immersed in a magnetic field i. 'Ihe magnetic field (j) is
uniform in into the page. but Changes with time according to t e
Considering the time interval O < t < I second, answer the following qLæstions.
a) Derive an expression for thc magnitude of the
induced current in terms Of a and assuming cach
side ofthe triangle has a resistance R What is
the direction of thc induced current (ckxkwise or
counter clockwise)? (6 marks)
