A cylindrical capacitor consisting of two coaxial cylinders of radius a and b (b>a) and length 
(L) where L>>b is shown in the Figure below. The inner shell has a total charge of +q and the 
outer shell has a total charge of -q. Fringing is neglected. 
Develop the following relationships in terms of a, b, and L for: 
a) Electric Field between two plates. 
b) Electric Potential (Voltage) between two plates. 
c) Capacitance of this device.

A square wire loop with 4 m sides is perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field with half the 
area of the loop in the field as shown below. The resistance of the loop is R = 4 Ω and the loop 
contains a 20 V battery. The magnitude of the filed varies with time according to:  
𝑩= (𝟎. 𝟎𝟒𝟐−𝟎. 𝟖𝟕𝒕) 
(Tesla) 
 
a) Draw an electric circuit showing the loop resistance, induced emf, and the emf (voltage) 
from the battery. 
Determine: 
b) The magnitude of the induced emf in the circuit. 
c) The magnitude of the total (net) emf in the circuit. 
d) The magnitude of the induced current.  
e) The amount and direction of the total (net) current in the loop for the given R = 4 Ω.
