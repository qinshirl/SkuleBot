Dear 2T3s (and upcoming froshes), 
 
This document is basically my ‘condensed notes’, which is summary of whole course. It 
is based on professor Mojahedi’s lecture in 2018-2019 academic year. Hopefully it will 
guide your study for this course! Please do not rely on this note though, as curriculum 
can vary by year, and professors are doing examples which will aid your understandings 
on course materials. This note is written to show the concepts in relatively short time, 
not for giving examples. Make sure to go to your own lectures!! 
 
You will see most of concepts in second year and onward! First part of ECE110 is 
repeated with calculus 3 concepts in ECE221, and second part is repeated and continued 
in ECE212 (then 231). So DO NOT forget those concepts!! 
 
The note is taken in OneNote and snipped afterwards, so some points might be blurry! 
Also don’t freak out with 50+ pages, I had to break my notes for clear images. Good luck 
with your second semester!!
