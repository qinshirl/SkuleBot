General Information Handout 
 
Welcome to ECE244! This handout provides high-level information about the course, including 
its organization, components, reference material, assessment and topics covered. Please read it 
and keep it for reference during the term. 
 
 
Calendar Description 
 
Provides a foundation in programming using an object-oriented programming language. Topics 
include classes and objects, inheritance, exception handling, basic data structures (lists, tree, 
etc.), Big-O complexity analysis, and testing and debugging. The laboratory assignments 
emphasize the use of object-oriented programming constructs in the design and implementation 
of reasonably large programs.

Learning Outcomes 
 
At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to: 
1. Write C++ code that utilizes encapsulation and code reuse features of the C++ 
programming language. 
2. Understand basic data structures, such as arrays, linked lists and trees, and write C++ 
code to implement and manipulate them. 
3. Express the run-time complexity of simple algorithmic segments using big-O notation. 
4. Utilize modern programing tools, such as compilers, debuggers and IDEs. 
 
 
Industrial Relevance 
 
Object-oriented programming is the most wide-spread programming paradigm today. Every 
application that runs on a mobile device (phone or tablet) and much of the code that runs on 
desktops and servers is written using an object-oriented language, such as C++, Java or C#. A 
firm grasp of this paradigm is key to modern software development.

The e-book is available in one of two options. The e-Text by itself (ISBN: 9780134521176) is 
available for either 6-month access or lifetime access from VitalSource at the following link 
(the link is also be placed on the course’s web site):  
 
https://www.vitalsource.com/en-ca/products/problem-solving-with-c-pod-file-
walter-savitch-v9780134521176?term=9780134448282 
 
The book is also available bundled with MyLab Programming, an online collection of 
programming exercises and online tutorials (ISBN: 9780134522418). It is available at the 
University of Toronto Bookstore as a digital code at the following link: 
 
https://www.campusebookstore.com/integration/AccessCodes/default.aspx?b
ookseller_id=96&Course=STG+ECE244+PROBLEM+SOLVING+WITH+C
%2b%2b&t=permalink 
 
The use of MyLab is optional and is not required for the course. It is up to you to decide if you 
if MyLab is of value to you or not. If you decide to use MyLab, you will need to register your 
MyLab using the following link and Course ID to join:

You may also use a hardcopy of the book, if you are able to obtain one, either new or used. In 
this case, it is not necessary to buy the latest edition; any edition past the 7th edition (i.e., 8th or 
the 9th) is adequate for the purposes of the course. 
 
In addition to the textbook, you may consult with a wealth of reference material and excellent 
tutorials on the C++ programming language on the Web. Here are two examples: 
 
 
• C plus plus: http://www.cplusplus.com 
 
• Sharam Hekmat (pragsoft.com) C++ Programming: 
http://www.pragsoft.com/books/CppEssentials.pdf

Lectures 
 
Lectures introduce and cover new concepts related to the topics of the course. The lectures are 
delivered synchronously three times a week, as shown in the timetable above. It is highly 
recommended that you attend the (live) synchronous lectures. Attending gives you a chance to 
interact with the instructor, pose questions in real time as well as participate in answering 
questions and discussions. The synchronous lectures will be recorded, and the recording of a 
lecture will be made available on the course’s web site shortly after the lecture. 
 
Tutorials 
 
The tutorials are intended to review basic programming concepts and revisit material already 
covered in the lectures in a more interactive setting, where questions can be asked frequently 
and freely. In contrast to the lectures, no new material will be introduced, and often only basic 
material will be reviewed. As such, attending the tutorials is not mandatory. The tutorials are 
offered synchronously and will be recorded. Recordings will be available on the course’s web 
site shortly after each tutorial is finished. 
 
 
Lecture and Tutorial Recording  
 
This course, including your participation, will be recorded on video and will be available to 
students in the course for viewing remotely and after each session. Your participation in a 
lecture or a tutorial implies your consent to recording. In addition, course videos and materials 
belong to your instructor, the University, and/or other sources depending on the specific facts 
of each situation and are protected by copyright. You agree not to download, copy, or share 
any course or student materials or videos without the explicit permission of the instructor. 
For questions about recording and use of videos, please contact your instructor. 
 
 
Laboratory Assignments 
 
The lab assignments consist of a number of programming exercises using the C++ 
programming language. Please refer to the “Laboratory Information Handout” for a list of the 
assignments, their schedule, due dates as well as general information about the labs.  
 
The lab assignments do take a substantial amount of your time. Hence, it is important to start 
as early as possible on your assignments and to avoid procrastination. Lab assignments are 
always due at 5:00pm on their due date (also shown in the Topics Outline section below). You 
are to do each assignment by yourself, i.e., individually. Sharing code or submitting code that is 
written by someone else will be checked for, will not be tolerated and will be treated as an 
academic offence. 
 
 
Assessment and Evaluation 
 
Assessment is done through quizzes, the programming assignments and a final examination. 
 
There are 7 quizzes that focus on both the lecture material and the programming assignments. 
The quizzes are delivered through the course’s web site. The quizzes are asynchronous. Each

quiz becomes available at 00:00:01 on the day of the quiz and closes on 23:59:59 on that same 
day. This enables you to start the quiz at a time that is convenient for you. However, once you 
start the quiz, you must finish it in the duration of the quiz. That is, you cannot leave the quiz 
and come back to it at a later time. Thus, you need to plan ahead and make sure you are 
available for the duration of the quiz. The dates of the quizzes are given in Topics Outline 
section below. 
 
A final examination is given during the final exams’ period at the end of the term. The exact 
date, time and delivery method of the exam will be announced closer to the end of the term. 
 
The composition of the final mark is as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Topic Outline 
 
The following table is a weekly list of the topics covered in the course, and the corresponding 
reference in the textbook. Chapters are from the 10th edition of the “Problem Solving with 
C++” textbook; earlier editions may have slightly different chapter numbers, but essentially the 
same content. The table also shows labs for each week, along with each lab’s due date. Finally, 
the table shows the Quiz dates. 
 
Please keep in mind that this list of topics and their scheduled dates is tentative and is intended 
to serve as only a guide. Varying pace of material delivery may require changes to this list of 
topics and/or the schedule.

Land Acknowledgement 
 
I (we) wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For 
thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most 
recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to 
many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity 
to work on this land.
