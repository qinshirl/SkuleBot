Q1 (10 points)
Consider a rod without sources of thermal energy and whose lateral surface area is not insulated. Assume that heat energy ﬂowing out of the
lateral surface per unit surface area per time is proportional to the temperature diﬀerence between the rod and the outside temperature 
.
Assume that the lateral perimetre is  adn the cross-sectional area is .
Derive the PDE for the temperature 
.
Q2 (10 points)
What is the equilibrium temperature distribution for a 1D rod with 
 composed of two diﬀerent materials in perfect thermal
contact at 
:
for 
, the material has 
 and there is a constant source 
;
for 
, the material has 
 and there is no source 
.
Q3 (10 points)

Show that there are no negative eigenvalues.
Q4 (10 points)
Calculate 
.
