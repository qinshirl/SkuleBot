(4 marks) Consider Laplace equation with boundary conditions: 
uxx  + uyy - 0 
u(x,0) = 20 
u(x,2) = 30 
u(0, y) = 10

for 0< x,y < 2 
for 0 < x <2 
for 0 < x < 2 
for 0 < y < 2 
for 0 < y < 2 
Consider the approximation of uxx  and the corresponding approximation of u,. 
When A = 1, we have

6. Captain Ahab wants to capture the whale Moby Dick. 
(16 marks) 
He knows that Moby Dick likes fish, so his plan is to harvest a lot of fish to use it as bait to capture 
Moby Dick. 
Ahab throws the fishing net into the water and steers Pequod, his whaling ship, towards the areas 
with the most fish. 
The ship is moving at v m/s and is harvesting 1 of the existing fish per second. 
Define: 
p(x, y, t) = density of fish, in fish per m2  at the position (x, y) and at time t (in seconds); 
(t) = (x(t), y(t)) = position of the Pequod (the ship) at time t. 
(a) (4 marks) What is the fish density underneath the Pequod?
