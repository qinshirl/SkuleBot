We will start 10 minutes past the hour. Use this time to make
a new friend.

Scenario 1: Population Growth with Resource Limits

Context: A population of deer is introduced into a large fenced
park. Initially, the population grows rapidly, but the environment
has limited resources (space, food). When the population is small,
it grows approximately proportionally to its size. The growth rate
slows down as population P(t) approaches a maximum population
of 500 (the carrying capacity).
Derive an ODE that describes the population growth.

What are the equilibrium values of P? What do these mean
biologically?

Variant: Introducing Constant Harvesting

Extension: Suppose park rangers harvest a ﬁxed number of deer
per year for population control. How does this change your
model? Determine the new equilibrium values and interpret
them. Under what harvesting rate will the population
collapse?

Scenario 2: Mixing Tank with Salt Solution

Context: A tank initially contains 100 L of pure water. A salt
solution with concentration 0.5 kg/L ﬂows in at 4 L/min. The
tank is well-mixed, and the outﬂow is also 4 L/min. Derive a
di!erential equation for A(t). Find the equilibrium value and
interpret it.

Variant: Tank Fills and Overﬂows

Extension: Now the inﬂow rate is 6 L/min and the outﬂow is 4
L/min. The tank starts with 50 L of water and can hold up to 120
L before it overﬂows.
Derive a model for A(t) before overﬂow starts. What might
happen once the tank reaches capacity?

Scenario 3: iPhone Adoption Over Time

Context: A new iPhone model is released. Early adopters quickly
buy the phone, but over time the pool of new customers shrinks.
The rate at which new people adopt the phone slows down.
Assume the total market size is 10 million people and the adoption
rate is proportional to the number of people who haven’t bought it
yet
Derive a di!erential equation for N(t). What is the
equilibrium, and what does it represent? How does the
adoption curve behave over time?

Variant: Inﬂuence from Existing Users

Extension: Suppose people are more likely to buy the phone if
their friends already have it. Now adoption depends both on how
many haven’t bought it and how many already have.

Derive the updated di!erential equation. How might the
adoption rate change early vs. late in the product cycle? Is
this model reasonable?
