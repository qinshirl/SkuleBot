1. Keep this booklet closed, until an invigilator announces that the test has 

begun.

2. Please place your student ID card in a location on your desk that is easy 

for an invigilator to check without disturbing you during the test.

3. Please write your answers into the boxes. Ample space is provided within 
each box, however, if you must use additional space, please use the blank 
page at the end of this booklet, and clearly indicate in the given box that 
your answer is continued on the blank page. You can also use the blank 
pages as scrap paper. Do not remove them from the booklet.

4. This test booklet contains 16 pages, excluding the cover page, and 8 questions.

5. Do not remove any page from this booklet.

6. Remember to show all your work for part B and C unless the question 

explicitly says not to. You don’t need to justify your choices in part A.

7. You may use your one pre-written page of notes, written on faculty approved 
exam-aid sheet. Your notes should be handwritten. Any other note written 
on any other paper is considered academic dishonesty. You should write your 
name and student number on your pre-written note.

8. You may use a Casio FX-991 or Sharp EL-W516 calculator. Any other type 
of calculator on your desk is considered academic dishonesty. Please be ready 
to show your calculator to the invigilators if asked.

3. You don’t need to include your computation or reasoning for this question.

A chemical C is formed during the reaction of two other chemicals, A and B. As C 
is formed, chemicals A and B are gradually eliminated such that the total mass of the 
chemicals remains constant.
(a) (2 points) Let i/(t) denote the mass of chemical C (in kg) at time t (in minutes), 
and suppose that it takes j kg of A and | kg of S to make 1 kg of C. If chemicals 
A and B have an initial amount of 20 kg each, determine the functions ^^(t) and 
mB(t) that give the mass of the chemicals A and B respectively, in terms of ?/(t), 
at time t.

(b) (3 points) Suppose that C is formed at a rate that is proportional to the product 
of the remaining mass of A and B that are present at time t. After half an hour, 
C begins to transform into a new chemical D at a rate that is proportional to the 
square of the mass of C at time t.

Provide a piecewise initial value problem (IVP) that governs the mass of chemical 
C at time t, from t = 0 to t = to (where to > 30 and 7/(to) = 0)-

final answer

(c) (1 point) Select ALL that apply.

population. Suppose p(t) is the population at time t, measured in days.

days. Write down a differential equation that describes this population under these 
conditions. Your final answer should not include any parameter.

and 23 are eaten by the local bird population. Write a diflFerential equation that 
models the population.

or will it die out? Justify your answer. O die out 

O survive
