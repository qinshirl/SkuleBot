(a) Show that W is a subspace of R4. Hint: The easiest way to do this is to show W is the span of some
vectors in R4 (c.f. Textbook, Theorem 2, page 18). This will also help you answer part (b) below.

Therefore, for any vector x ∈ W , we have x = av1 + bv2 + cv3, for some a, b, c ∈ R, so that W =
span{v1, v2, v3}. Using Theorem 2, page 18, it follows that W is a subspace of R4.

(b) Find a basis for W . Hint: Use Textbook, Theorem 3, page 20.

Solution:
In part (a), we have proved that W = span{v1, v2, v3}. Notice that v3 = v2 + v1.
Therefore, using Theorem 3, page 20, it follows that W = span{v1, v2}. Also, notice that v1 and v2
are linearly independent, because of the following:

which gives, b = −a and b = −2a, so that a = 0 and b = 0 is the only solution for this system of
equations. Therefore, v1 and v2 are linearly independent. With this, and using the deﬁnition of basis
set, it follows that v1 and v2 form a basis for W .

(c) Determine the dimension of W .

Solution: The dimension of W is 2 because the basis set of W consists of 2 vectors.

2. Let x1, x2, x3, x4 be vectors in Rn. Suppose that x3 = x1 − x2 and x4 = 2x1 + 3x2 − x3. Suppose

W = span{x1, x2, x3, x4}.

(a) What are the possible dimensions of W ?

Solution: To determine the possible dimensions of W , we should ﬁnd the possible number of linearly
independent vectors in W . Since any vector in W is a linear combination of x1, x2, x3, and x4, then
we should ﬁnd which vectors among these vectors are linearly independent. Notice that x3 = x1 − x2
and x4 = 2x1 + 3x2 − x3 = x1 + 4x2. Therefore, x3 and x4 are linearly dependent on x1 and x2.
Therefore, W = span{x1, x2}. With this, the possible dimensions of W are 0 (if x1 = x2 = 0), 1 (if
x1 and x1 are non-zeros but linearly dependent), or 2 (if x1 and x2 are linearly independent).

(b) Suppose dim(W ) = 2. Must {x3, x4} be linearly independent?

Solution: If dim(W ) = 2, then x1 and x2 are linearly independent. Thus, ax1 + bx2 = 0 if and only
if a = b = 0. Suppose that there exist a(cid:48), b(cid:48) ∈ R such that a(cid:48)x3 + b(cid:48)x4 = 0. In the following, we will
show that a(cid:48) = b(cid:48) = 0, so that x3 and x4 must be linearly independent.

a(cid:48)x3 + b(cid:48)x4 = 0
a(cid:48)(x1 − x2) + b(cid:48)(x1 + 4x2) = 0
(a(cid:48) + b(cid:48))x1 + (−a(cid:48) + 4b(cid:48))x2 = 0

But x1 and x2 are linearly independent, so that (a(cid:48) + b(cid:48)) = 0 and (−a(cid:48) + 4b(cid:48)) = 0, which is equivalent
to a(cid:48) = b(cid:48) = 0. Therefore, x3 and x4 must be linearly independent.

3. Let W be a subspace of Rn of dimension k. Show that

(a) Any set of k vectors that span W must also be linearly independent and so form a basis for W .

Solution: Let W = span{v1, v2, . . . , vk} be a subspace of Rn of dimension k. Assume towards a
contradiction that {v1, v2, . . . , vk} are not linearly independent. This means that one of these vectors
can be written as a linear combination of the rest. Without loss of generality, assume that this vector
is vk, i.e. vk = a1v1 + · · · + akvk. Then, using Theorem 3, page 20, W = span{v1, v2, . . . , vk−1}.
With this, dim(W ) ≤ k − 1 < k, a contradiction that completes the proof. Therefore, {v1, . . . , vk} are
k linearly independent vectors of W . It follows that they form a basis for W .

(b) Any linearly independent set of k vectors from W must also span W and so form a basis for W .

Hint: You may ﬁnd Textbook, Lemma 6, page 98 helpful.

Solution: Let {x1, x2, . . . , xk} be a basis for W , because dim(W ) = k. Notice that span{x1, x2, . . . , xk} =
W, due to deﬁnition of basis. Let {v1, v2, . . . , vk} be a set of k vectors in W that are linearly inde-
pendent. Let b ∈ W be an arbitrary vector. Due to Lemma 6, page 98, {b, v1, v2, . . . , vk} are linearly
dependent vectors. So, there exist c0, c1, . . . , ck, not all zero, such that:

c0b + c1v1 + · · · + ckvk = 0

If c0 = 0, then c1v1 + · · · + ckvk = 0 where c1, c2, . . . , ck are not all zero. But this contradicts the fact
that {v1, . . . , vk} is linearly independent! Therefore, c0 (cid:54)= 0. Thus, for any arbitrary b ∈ W , we can
write:

c1
c0
so that {v1, . . . , vk} span W . It follows that {v1, . . . , vk} also forms a basis for W .
This result is a ”half-is-good-enough” type theorem. It says that IF you know that the dimension of
a subspace W is k any set of k linearly independent vectors from W is automatically a basis for W
(i.e. you needn’t check they span W ); and any set of k vectors from W that span W is automatically
a basis for W (i.e. you needn’t check they are linearly independent). For example, since the dimension
of R3 is 3, any set of 3 linearly independent vectors from R3 is a basis for R3.

Solution: Using the result from Problem 3, we only need to ﬁnd 3 linearly independent vectors.

Notice that x1 and x2 are linearly independent. Let x3 =

. We can check that the solution to

the system ax1 + bx2 + cx3 = 0 has only the trivial solution, so {x1, x2, x3} are linearly independent,
and thus, form a basis for R3

(b) Given linearly independent vectors x1 and x2 in R3, is it always possible to ﬁnd a third vector x3 such

that {x1, x2, x3} is a basis for R3? Explain.
Solution: Notice that dim(R3) = 3, so that we need 3 linearly independent vectors to form a basis R3
by question 3. Now, we know {x1, x2} do not span R3, i.e. span{x1, x2} (cid:54)= R3 which means we can
always ﬁnd a vector x ∈ R3, x (cid:54)∈ span{x1, x2}. This would mean that the set {x, x1, x2} is linearly
independent (why?) set of 3 vectors from R3 and so a basis for R3.

. Construct a system of 4 equations and 4 unknowns using:

c1x1 + c2x2 + c3x3 + c4x4 = 0. Notice that the only solution for this system is the trivial solution, i.e.
c1 = c2 = c3 = c4 = 0. Therefore, {x1, x2, x3, x4} are linearly independent, and so, {x1, x2, x3} are
also linearly independent.

(d) Given linearly independent vectors x1 and x2 in R4, is it always possible to ﬁnd vectors x3 and x4

such that {x1, x2, x3, x4} is a basis for R4? Explain.
Solution: We mimic part (b) above. Notice that dim(R4) = 4, so that we need 4 linearly indepen-
dent vectors to form a basis for R4 by question 3. Now, we know {x1, x2} does not span R4, i.e.
span{x1, x2} (cid:54)= R4 which means that we can always ﬁnd a vector x ∈ R4, x (cid:54)∈ span{x1, x2}. Then,
the set {x, x1, x2} is linearly independent (why?). We know that {x, x1, x2} does not span R4 either,

3 of 4

i.e. span{x, x1, x2} (cid:54)= R4, which means that we can always ﬁnd a vector y ∈ R4, y (cid:54)∈ span{x, x1, x2}.
Then again the set {y, x, x1, x2} is linearly independent set of 4 vectors from R4 and so a basis for R4.

Notice that this procedure holds in general. Given k linearly independent vectors {x1, x2, . . . , xk} in
Rn you can always ﬁnd vectors xk+1, . . . , xn in Rn so that {x1, . . . , xk, xk+1, . . . xn} is a basis for Rn.
