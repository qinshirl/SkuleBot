MAT188H1F LINEAR ALGEBRA: Course Information as of
August 26, 2014
This is a ﬁrst course in linear algebra. Although this material is intrinsically simpler than calculus, it
may seem more diﬃcult, because it is more abstract than calculus. But once you get used to the new
concepts you will ﬁnd that the computations in this course are more routine than those in calculus.
Section Instructors: by now you should be scheduled into one of the following Sections:

LEC0101 Qian, L. LEC0102 Schachter, B. LEC0103 Loizides, Y. LEC0104 Shen, X.
LEC0105 Lein, M. LEC0106 Burbulla, D.

LEC0107 Pavlov, A.

LEC0108 Eskandari, P.

Textbook: Elementary Linear Algebra with Applications by Jeﬀrey Holt. Warning: this is only the
second time we are using Holt’s book. Its order of topics is totally diﬀerent than the order of
topics in books we were using previously. Keep this in mind when you look at old tests and
exams prior to 2013. Moreover, Holt includes much more material on linear transformations than
our previous books, but less material on vectors in three dimensions than our previous books.
Anything you know from high school—such as the dot product, the cross product, equations of
lines and planes in three dimensions—can be used in this course, if it helps you.

Homework: some exercises have been picked as suggested homework; see the back of this page.

These are the ones that your TA should be prepared to help you with.

Tutorials: you should attend your tutorial on a regular basis; it is one place you can get help with
your homework. However, it is totally impractical to assume that all the homework questions
can be covered in tutorial; you should try and solve as many homework problems as you can, on
your own, and then ask your TA about the questions you couldn’t get. Tutorials start Monday,
Sep 8th and end Monday, Dec 1st. There are no tutorials on Monday, Oct 13th. Each tutorial
group will meet twelve times.

Marking Scheme: Diagnostic Tests: 5%; WeBWorK: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 20%; Exam: 50%

Diagnostic Tests: to be written on Tuesday, Sep 9, times and locations TBA. The purpose of these
tests is to see if any students have gaps in their high school math, and then oﬀer help to these
students before real tests start.

WeBWorK: information regarding this on-line homework website will be posted on the course web-
site in the second week of classes. WeBWorK homework will not begin until September 22.

Test 1: a 100-min term test is scheduled for Tuesday, Sep 30, 12:15-1:55 PM, locations TBA.

Test 2: a 100-min term test is scheduled for Thursday, Nov 6, 6:15-7:55 PM, locations TBA.

Final Exam: there will be a common ﬁnal exam, 150 min long, during the exam period, Dec 8-19.

Math Aid Oﬃce: GB 149. Hours: MW 12-1, 3-4; TR 12-3

Calculators: Use of a Casio FX-991MS or Sharp EL-520X calculator will be permitted during all
quizzes, tests and exams. However, it is still your responsibility to explain your work. A correct
answer with no justiﬁcation will receive no marks.

Course Coordinator: D. Burbulla. Oﬃce: GB 149; email: burbulla@math.toronto.edu;

oﬃce hours: MW 12-1, 3-4; TR 12-3

Course Websites: In addition to the course websites which can be accessed through the U of T
portal there is the coordinator’s home page: http://www.math.toronto.edu/burbulla/

Classroom Deportment: the format of lectures is more formal than what you may be used to from
high school. During lectures there should not be any disruptions that would prevent other students
from hearing or seeing the instructor: no talking, no cell phones, no music, no eating or drinking. You
should raise your hand to ask a question. You should arrive on time. If you do arrive late, please
enter by a back door and sit down in the ﬁrst available seat so as not to disrupt the rest of the class.

Course Outline, Lecture Schedule and Tutorial Schedule: below are approximate schedules
of lecture and tutorial topics. As some lectures will be missed on Monday, Oct 13th, the schedule
presumes only 38 lectures. Sections marked with an asterisk (*) are optional and may not be covered
in class. They will not be tested. What each test covers will be announced during the term. Note: in
addition to the Suggested Homework Exercises you should try all the True or False questions in each
section!

We will not cover numerical methods, Sections 1.3 and 6.2. Some tutorial time will be spent on complex
numbers, reference Section 6.5, because they no longer seem to be covered in high school. Your lecturer
may or may not include complex eigenvalues in Sections 6.6. Either way, quizzes, tests and exams in
MAT188H1F will not require complex numbers. In Section 8.3 we’ll skip QR Factorization. We will
not cover any of Chapters 7, 9, 10 or 11.
