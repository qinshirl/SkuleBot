only walk on their constructed one-way paths, and they walk in a rhythmic pattern:
Every minute, at the start of the minute, each ant will randomly follow one of the paths.
If several paths are available, then an equal proportion of the ants will follow each of
them. By the end of the minute, they are at their destination. The locations and the
