LONG ANSWER PART

7. Consider the integral

√ π

2

(cid:90)

0

sin(x2) dx.

(13 marks)

This integral can’t be calculated using elementary functions, so we need to approximate it.

(a) (5 marks) If you want to make sure your approximation is less than the actual integral (that it

underestimates the integral), which method would you use to approximate this integral? Justify

your answer.

Hint. What is the sign of the derivative of the integrand?

(b) (5 marks) Your boss doesn’t want to know about your reasoning for (a) and she decides that

you must use the Right-hand rule. She also wants the error to be smaller than

intervals should you use? Justify your answer.

1
100

. How many

Hint 1. There is only one solution of 2z2 tan(z2) = 1 in (cid:2)0, (cid:112) π
2

(cid:3), whose values you can assume are

z1 = 0.8 and cos(z2

1) = 0.8.

OR
Hint 2. Note that (cid:112) π
2

(cid:54) 1.3.

(c) (3 marks) Consider a function f (x) which is continuous in the interval [0, 4] satisfying f (0) =

f (4) + 8 and consider the integral

Calculate L128 − R128.

(cid:90) 4

0

f (x) dx.

8. It’s the 1960’s and NASA is trying to ﬁnd out how much work it will take

(13 marks)

to get a spaceship to escape the gravitational pull of Earth. This means that the spaceship should

be able to keep going forever, getting further and further away from Earth.

The formula for work is W = F d, where F is the force acting on the object and d is the displacement.
GM m
r2
M is the mass of the Earth, m is the mass of the spaceship, and r is the distance from the centre of

, where G is the universal gravitational constant,

The gravitational pull of Earth has magnitude

the Earth. You can denote the radius of the Earth as R.

(a) (8 marks) Find an integral formula for the work it takes to bring a spaceship from the surface

of the Earth to a distance h from the surface.

Explain every step and deﬁne all your variables and constants.

(You can continue your answer to (a) on the next page)

(b) (1 mark) Find an integral formula for the work it takes for a spaceship starting from the surface

of the Earth to go on forever, getting further and further away from Earth. Justify your answer.

(c) (4 marks) Is the amount of work you found in (b) ﬁnite or inﬁnite? Justify your answer.

9. Consider two functions f (t) and g(t) that satisfy the properties:

(12 marks)

(P1) f 2(t) + g2(t) = 1

for all t;

(P2) f (cid:48)(t) = g(t)
1
tg(t)

(P3) g(cid:48)(t) =

for all t;

for all t (cid:54)= 0.

We want to study the integral

(cid:90) (cid:112)

1 − x2 dx.

(a) (4 marks) As a ﬁrst step, use the substitution x = f (t) to show that

(cid:90) (cid:112)

1 − x2 dx =

(cid:90)

g2(t) dt.

Hint. Use properties (P1) and (P2).

(b) (4 marks) Now, integrate by parts to calculate the integral

(cid:90) (cid:112)

1 − x2 dx.

(c) (4 marks) This question is independent of the others.

Find a function g(t) that satisﬁes property (P3). Ignore the properties (P1) and (P2).
