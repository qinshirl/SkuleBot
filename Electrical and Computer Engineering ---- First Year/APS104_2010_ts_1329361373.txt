1.  (30 pts) The composition of air 79.0 mol% N2 and 21.0 mol% O2. An internal combustion 
engine burns pure propane (C3H8). If air is fed to the engine to provide the necessary 
(stoichiometric) O2 to ensure complete combustion to CO2 and H2O, calculate: 
(a)  (10 pts) The volume of air at 15 oC and 1.02 bar, needed for the complete combustion of 

1 mol of propane. 

(b) (10 pts) The mol% and partial pressure of N2 in the exhaust, which leaves the engine at 

200oC and 1.00 bar.  

(c)  (10 pts) To calculate the volume of air you have assumed the air behaves like an ideal 
gas. What are the assumptions of the ideal gas model and give one reason (described in terms 
of the molecules of a gas) why these assumptions might not hold in a real gas. 

Answers: 

(a)  C3H8 (g) + 5O2 (g) (cid:2) 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (g) 

Need 5 moles of oxygen to burn 1 mole of propane and 1 mole air only 21% oxygen. 
nair = # moles propane*#moles oxygen per mole propane*moles oxygen per mole air 
       = 1*5/0.21 = 23.8 mol air per mol of C3H8 required. 

Vair = nRT/P = 23.8mol*0.0831bar*L/(mol*k)*288K/1.02bar = 558L  

(b) consider total moles of gas in exhaust after combustion of 1 mole of propane: 

 moles 

O2      0 (all consumed) 
C3H8     0 (all consumed) 
[1*5/0.21]*0.79 = 18.8  (no moles of air*79% since air is 79% N2 
N2 
CO2 
3 
H2O  4 
total 

 25.8  

mol % N2 = (18.8/25.8) x 100 = 72.8 % 

PN2 = n*PT = 0.728*1.00 bar = 0.728 bar 

(c) Assumptions are that the molecules are point sources and that they don’t interact. In a 
real gas there might be interactions between the molecules such that they do interact thus 
invalidating the ideal gas law assumptions. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  (40 pts) You are interested in compressing 10L of air, initially at a temperature of 25°C and 
1 bar, to a final pressure of 10 bar using a piston-cylinder device. You decided to evaluate 
two  different  paths.  Path  1:  isothermal  reversible  compression.  Path  2:  adiabatic  reversible 
compression. Assume that cV (or as in the book Cv,m) is 3/2R for air. 

a)  (15 pts) Calculate the final volume and work for path 1.  
b)  (15 pts) Calculate the final volume and work for path 2. 
c)  (10  pts)  Explain  why  there  is  a  difference  in  the  work  calculated  for  the  2  paths 
(consider the motion of molecules in your argument), and select the most efficient path. 

Answers: 

(a)  At the final conditions of the isothermal compression, Tf = Ti = 298K , Pf =10 bar, and 

the value of “n” can be calculated from the initial conditions: 
n= PiV/RT= 1 bar*10L/(0.0831 bar*L/(K*mol)*298K) =  0.403 mol  

Final volume, Vf = nRT/PF = 0.403 mol*0.0831bar*L/(K*mol)*298K/10bar = 1L 

The work for an isothermal reversible process = -nRTln(Vf/Vi)  
W = -0.403mol*8.31J/(mol*K)*298K*ln(1L/10L)) = 2.30E+3 J = 2.30kJ 

(b) For an adiabatic, reversible process Tf = Ti*(Pf/Pi)(R/Cp) 
Cp = Cv+R = 3/2R+R = 5/2R , R/Cp = 2/5 =0.4 , then: 

(c)  Tf = Ti*(Pf/Pi)(R/Cp)= 298K*(10bar/1bar)0.4 = 748K 
Vf = nRTF/PF = 0.403mol*0.0831bar*L/(K*mol)*748K/10bar = 2.51L 

For an adiabatic process, W=(cid:1)U = nCv(cid:1)T = 0.403mol*3/2*8.31J/(mol*K)*(748-298)K 
W = 2.22E+3J = 2.26kJ 

(d) In the adiabatic process, as we compress the gas, the molecules are pushed against each 
other  and  this  causes  an  increase  in  kinetic  energy  and  temperature.  This,  in  turn, 
increases the number of collisions against the walls, which helps increasing the pressure, 
with less work than in the isothermal case. In the isothermal case one “cools down” the 
gas as the compression progresses. If the goal is simply reach a high pressure, then the 
adiabatic  path  requires  less  work,  in  which  case  is  the  more  efficient.  If  the  goal  is  to 
reduce the volume, the isothermal is the most efficient because with similar work  (about 
2.5  kJ)    the  isothermal  path  reaches  less  than  half  of  the  final  volume  of  the  adiabatic 
path. 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  (30 pts) Using the enthalpy of reactions indicated in the table below, obtain:  

(a)  (10 pts) The standard enthalpy of formation of SO3(g) ((cid:1)H°f SO3(g)) at 25°C and 1.0 atm.  
(b) (10 pts) The standard internal energy of formation of SO3(g) ((cid:1)U°f SO3(g)) at 25°C and 1.0 
atm.  
(c)  (10 pts) Under what condition would the enthalpy of formation of SO3(g) be the same at 
100°C as at 25°C? Explain your answer 

 Reactions 
(I) S(s) + O2(g) (cid:4) SO2(g) 
(II) 2SO2(g)+ O2(g)(cid:4) SO3(g) 

(cid:1)H°, kJ/mol 
-296.90 
-196.56 

Answers 
(a)  

2S + 2O2  (cid:4)2SO2  
2SO2 + O2 (cid:4)2SO3 
2S + 3O2 (cid:4)2SO3   
This is for 2 moles of SO3 so must divide by 2 to get enthalpy of formation per mole 

(cid:1)H = -593.8 kJ 
(cid:1)H = -196.56 kJ 
(cid:1)H = -790.36 kJ 

(cid:1)H°fSO3(g) =  -395.18 kJ/mol 

(b)  
(cid:1)n per one mole of SO3 generated is -0.5 moles since go from 3/2 mol gas in reactants (cid:2) 1 
mole of gas in producs. 

(cid:1)U°fSO3(g) =  (cid:1)H°fSO3(g) - (cid:1)n(g)*RT° = -395.8kJ – (-0.5mol)*8.31E-3kJ/(mol*K)*298K       

       = -394.6kJ per mol of SO3(g)  formed. 

(c)  The only way that this heat of reaction would still be the same is if the heat capacity of 
the  reactants  and  products  is  balanced.  That  balance  is  expressed  in  the  term  (cid:1)Cp  = 
(cid:2)(cid:3)iCpi = 0. Otherwise, at a different T the enthalpy would have to be calculated using the 
heat capacities of all the reactants and products.
