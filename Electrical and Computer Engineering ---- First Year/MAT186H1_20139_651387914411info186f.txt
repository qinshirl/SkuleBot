MAT186H1F CALCULUS I: Course Information as of
August 27, 2013
MAT186H1F is an introduction to calculus and its applications. We assume only that you have seen
limits and some derivatives in your high school courses. We will start the course with a ‘review’ of
trigonometric formulas, and inverse trigonometric functions.

Section Instructors: By now you should be scheduled into one of the following Sections:

LEC0101 Cohen, S.
LEC0103 Burbulla, D. LEC0104 Shorser, L.

LEC0102 Tyros, K.

Textbook: The textbook for this course is Anton, Bivens & Davis’s Calculus, Early Transcendentals
Version, 10th edition. Any version of this book will do, be it hardcover or binder-ready softcover.

Marking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Quiz: 15%; Test: 30%; Exam: 50%

Tutorials: You should attend attend your tutorial on a regular basis; it is one place you can get help
with your homework, and it is the only place you can pick up your graded tests and have the
solutions taken up. One tutorial will be devoted to general advice. Another tutorial will ‘review’
conics, since these are no longer covered in high school. Tutorials start Monday, Sep 9th and
end Monday, Dec 2nd. There are no tutorials on Monday, Oct 14th.

Homework: All the odd-numbered exercises have answers in the back; consider them all as home-
work, although the ones that require a graphing utility or a computer algebra system are optional.

WeBWorK: Information regarding this on-line homework website will be posted on the course web-
site in the second week of classes. WeBWorK homework will not begin until September 23.

Quiz: One 50-min quiz is scheduled in your tutorial during the week of Nov 11-15.

Test: a 100-minute term test is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct 15, 12:10-1:55 PM, locations TBA.

Final Exam: There will be a common ﬁnal exam, 150 min long, during the exam period, Dec 9-20.

Math Aid Oﬃce: GB 149. Hours: MTWRF 12:10-2 PM

Calculators: Use of a Casio FX-991MS or Sharp EL-520X calculator will be permitted during all
quizzes, tests and exams. However, it is still your responsibility to explain your work. A correct
answer with no justiﬁcation will receive no marks.

Course Coordinator: D. Burbulla. Oﬃce: GB 149

email: burbulla@math.toronto.edu; oﬃce hours: MTWRF 12:10-2 PM.

portal there is the coordinator’s home page: http://www.math.toronto.edu/burbulla/
