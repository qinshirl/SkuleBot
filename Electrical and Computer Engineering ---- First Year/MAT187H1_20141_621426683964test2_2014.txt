4. Gravitational force decreases with the square of the distance, in particular we can write (6 Marks)

F =

mM G
y2

,

where y is the altitude of the object from the center of a planet of radius R and mass M , m is mass

of the object, and G is the gravitational constant.

To ﬁnd the escape velocity veveve, we know that the total kinetic energy of the object is 1
e , and that
it equals the work necessary to take the object from the surface of the planet (y = R) to inﬁnity

2 m v2

(y = ∞).

(a) Find the escape velocity (in terms of M , G, and R).
