1.  A particle travels on a path described by y = sin(x-π), as shown. The speed of the particle 

along the path is constant at 0.4 m/s.  

(a)  Determine the velocity ((cid:1874)(cid:3377)(cid:4667) of the particle at A expressed in the rectangular coordinates 

given. 

(b) Determine the velocity ((cid:1874)(cid:3377)(cid:4667) of the particle at A in polar (r-θ) coordinates, centered at 

point O indicated in the diagram. 

(c)  Determine the acceleration ((cid:1853)(cid:3377)(cid:4667) of the particle at A in normal-tangential (n-t) coordinates.

2.  A collar of mass 0.1 kg is free to slide on a frictionless rod in the horizontal plane as shown. 
A spring is positioned to restrict the movement of the collar and has an un-stretched length 
(lo) of 125 mm and a spring constant of k = 20 N/m. The rod is rotating at a constant angular 
speed of 5 rad/s and r is constant.  

(a)  Draw the free body diagram of the collar at the instant shown in the diagram. Indicate the 
exact directions that the forces exert on m.  You may omit all forces that exert at right 
angles to the plane of motion. 

(b) Determine the radial distance, r (neglect the width of the collar).

3.  A ball of mass mA = 2 kg, connected to a spring with an un-stretched length (lo) of 200 mm 
and a spring constant of k = 100 N/m, falls from rest through a frictionless channel and 
collides with a larger ball of mass mB = 5 kg, as shown. Ball A comes to rest immediately 
after impact. 

(a)  Find the speed of ball A as it exits the channel just before impact with ball B. 
(b) Find the speed of ball B immediately after impact. 
(c)  Find the maximum angle, θ, formed by ball B.
