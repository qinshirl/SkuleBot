Multiple Choice: No justification is required. Only your final answer will be graded.

1. Which of the intervals below represents the set of values of x for which |x + 1| < 1? [1 mark]

Indicate your final answer by filling in exactly one circle below (unfilled

filled ).

(−2, 0)

⃝ (0, 2)

⃝ (−2, 2)

⃝ (−∞, −2) ∪ (0, ∞)

⃝ (−∞, 0) ∪ (2, ∞)

Explanation: The inequality |x + 1| < 1 defines the set of points that are within 1 unit of -1, so −2 < x < 0.

2. Which of the intervals below represents the entire domain of f (x) =

ln(ln x)
x − 4

? [1 mark]

Indicate your final answer by filling in exactly one circle below (unfilled

filled ).

⃝ (−∞, 4) ∪ (4, ∞)

⃝ (0, 4) ∪ (4, ∞)

(1, 4) ∪ (4, ∞)

⃝ (e, 4) ∪ (4, ∞)

⃝ (4, ∞)

Explanation: Recall that the domain of ln x is x > 0. Therefore, ln(ln x) is defined when ln x > 0, that is when x > 1.
We must also exclude x = 4 in the domain of the function ln(ln x)
x−4 . Therefore, the set of numbers in (1, 4) ∪ (4, ∞) is the
domain.

Multiple Choice: No justification is required. Only your final answer will be graded.

Use the following information to answer Questions 3 & 4 below, and Question 5 on the next page.

Based on the principle of conservation of energy, an object’s Escape Velocity represents the minimum speed it
must be travelling to “escape” from the gravitational attraction of a nearby massive body, such as a planet. In
particular, for some object escaping the gravitational attraction of a body with fixed mass M ≫ 0 (measured
in kilograms kg), the escape velocity ve (measured in metres per second m
s ) when the escaping object is a
distance r (measured in meters m) from the centre of the massive body is given as:

Use the following information to answer Question 5 below. (This paragraph is repeated from the previous page.)

Based on the principle of conservation of energy, an object’s Escape Velocity represents the minimum speed it
must be travelling to “escape” from the gravitational attraction of a nearby massive body, such as a planet. In
particular, for some object escaping the gravitational attraction of a body with fixed mass M ≫ 0 (measured
in kilograms kg), the escape velocity ve (measured in metres per second m
s ) when the escaping object is a
distance r (measured in meters m) from the centre of the massive body is given as:

In the equation, G is the positive-valued Universal Gravitational Constant.

r

5. Which of the statements below most accurately describes the meaning of the inverse of ve(r)? [1 mark]

Indicate your final answer by filling in exactly one circle below (unfilled

filled ).

⃝ The inverse of ve(r) gives the accumulated distance r of an escaping object from a body with mass M when it

is travelling at speed ve.

The inverse of ve(r) gives the distance r between a body of mass M and an escaping object such that the object
will escape the gravitational attraction of the massive body when its speed is ve.

⃝ The inverse of ve(r) gives the speed ve required for an object to escape the gravitational attraction of a body

with mass M when the distance between the massive body and the object is r.

⃝ The inverse of ve(r) has no meaning since ve(r) is not invertible on its domain.

⃝ The inverse of ve(r) has no meaning since ve(r) is not invertible on r ∈ R.

Explanation: From the previous part, we know that ve(r) is an invertible function. As ve(r) gives velocity as a function
of distance, the inverse of ve(r) will give distance as a function of velocity.

f (x) is continuous at -2

g(f (x)) exists and g(f (0)) is defined.

g(f (x)) does not exist but g(f (0)) is defined.

g(f (x)) exists but g(f (0)) is undefined.

⃝ g(f (x)) is continuous at 0.

Solution: We see from the graph of f that it is continuous at x = −2. We also know that g(f (0)) is defined since
g(f (x)) exists since if x is in an interval around 0 (but not exactly
g(f (0)) = g(−2) = 2. Furthermore, we know that lim
x→0

0), f (x) is approaching −2 from above. Therefore, we conclude that,

using the graph of g. However, g(f (x)) is not continuous at x = 0 since lim

Solution: If x is in an interval around −3, g(x) takes on the constant value 2. Therefore, near x = −3, we conclude that
f (g(x)) takes on the constant value f (2) = 3. We conclude that lim
x→−3

f (g(x)) = 3.

way.

8. Decide if the following statements are true or false. If the statement is true, explain why. If the statement is false,
either give a formula for f (x) or draw a possible graph of f (x) that is a counterexample (that is, it satisfies the hypothesis
of the statement but not the conclusion).

Indicate your final answer by filling in exactly one circle corresponding to your choice (unfilled

(a) If a is in the domain of f (x), then lim

If a is in the domain of f (x), it is possible for lim

way. Put your final answer in the box provided.

9. Suppose you have two pieces of wire that are exactly 10 cm long each. You hold the pieces together horizontally and
cut at approximately their midpoint, leaving you with two pairs of wires; a pair on your left of equal length, and a pair
on your right of equal length. The pair on your left may differ in length from the pair on your right. You then arrange
the four pieces to form a rectangular frame.

How close to the midpoint does your cut need to be if you want the area inside the frame to be within 1cm2 of 25cm2?
[4 marks]

Let x be distance from the midpoint where you have cut the wires. We now have two pieces of wire of length 5 − x and
two pieces of wire of length 5 + x. The area of the frame is therefore (5 − x)(5 + x) = 25 − x2 (cm2).

To ensure that the frame is within ±1cm2 of 25cm2, we must ensure that

24 ≤ 25 − x2 ≤ 26.

We have 25 − x2 ≤ 26 is always true since x2 ≥ 0 for all x. To ensure that 24 ≤ 25 − x2, we must have x2 ≤ 1, or |x| ≤ 1.

Therefore, we must cut within 1cm of the midpoint to guarantee our area is within the acceptable error.

You must cut within

1cm of the midpoint

Now, for 0 ≤ x < π

12. Show that the equation

has at least two solutions. [6 marks]

x186 +

188
x2 + 1 + cos2 x

= 100

First, observe that x2 + cos2 x + 1 ≥ 1 and therefore, x2 + 1 + cos2 x is strictly positive for all real numbers. We conclude
that x2 + 1 + cos2 x is never zero, and our function

f (x) = x186 +

188
x2 + 1 + cos2 x

is a continuous function for all real x. Furthermore, our argument also shows that so f (x) ≥ x186 for all real x since

188
x2 + 1 + cos2 x

is a positive number.

At this point, there are several methods that can be used to reach the solution.

Method 1 - “Strict” IVT Argument: We know that f (0) = 188

2 = 96 and f (2) ≥ 2186. Since

f (0) = 96 < 100 < 2186 < f (2)

and f (x) is continuous, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees a solution f (c) = 100 with 0 < c < 2. To show that
there is a second solution, observe that f (−2) also satisfies f (−2) ≥ 2186. Therefore, the Intermediate Value Theorem
guarantees a solution f (d) = 100 with −2 < d < 0. We are guaranteed c ̸= d as c is positive and d is negative, so
f (x) = 100 has at least two distinct solutions.

Method 2 - IVT-Like Argument: We observe that lim
x→∞

f (x) → ∞ and similarly,

lim
x→−∞

f (x) → ∞ since f (x) ≥ x186

for all real x. Therefore, since f (0) = 96, 100 > 96 and f is continuous, f (x) = 100 has must have at least one positive
and one negative solution.

Method 3 - A Symmetry Argument: Finally, we can observe that f (x) is an even function (that is f (−x) = f (x)).
This is because (−x)n = xn for any even n and cos(−x) = cos x. Therefore, if we can show that f (c) = 100 for some value
of c ̸= 0 (using Solution 1 or 2), we will also have f (−c) = f (c) = 100. Solutions −c and c must be distinct since c ̸= 0.
