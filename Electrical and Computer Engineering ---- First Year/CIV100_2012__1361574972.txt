1.  Steel beam ABC, supported by a pin at A and a 
roller at B, is subjected to a distributed load, a 
couple moment, and a point load as shown. 
Determine the internal normal force, shear force 
and moment at points C, D, E. Point E is located 
just to the right of the roller support at B, where the 
couple moment acts.

2.  A compound beam, supported by a fixed connection 
at A and a roller at C, is subjected to a uniformly 
distributed load and a point load as shown. There is 
also an internal pin at B.  Determine the internal 
normal force, shear force and moment at points D 
and E. Point load is located just to the right of E.

3.  A simply supported beam, having a pin at A and 
a roller at B, carries a distributed load, a couple 
moment and a point load as shown. Determine 
the internal normal force, shear force and 
moment at points D and E, which are located just 
to the right of distributed load and point E 
respectively.

4.   Neatly draw the moment and shear diagrams for the beams in questions 1, 2 and 3, using the 
area method. Draw diagrams underneath new beam sketches. Clearly indicate shear and 
moment values at all points. Compare your results with those found in questions 1, 2 and 3.
