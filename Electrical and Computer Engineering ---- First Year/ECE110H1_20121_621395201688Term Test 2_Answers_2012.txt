Question 1: [10 Marks]  
A conducting rod of R = 0.40 Ω resistance is pulled at a constant speed, v = 5 m/s, sliding along two 
frictionless and perfectly conducting rails that are separated by L = 10 cm as shown in the figure.   The rails 
are connected at one end by a perfectly conducting metal strip.  A non-uniform magnetic field of B = 3 x2 T 
is directed out of the page. 
(a)  Derive an expression for the magnetic flux in the 
area bound by the rod, the rails and the metal 
strip, in terms of L and x.  [2 marks]
