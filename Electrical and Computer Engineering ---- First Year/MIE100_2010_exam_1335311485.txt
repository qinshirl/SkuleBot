Question 3 

 A rectangular crate of mass 100 kg rests on a conveyor belt as shown.  The crate’s height and 
width are 1.40 metres and 0.80 metres respectively.  Assume the crate is uniform such that its 
centre of mass is located in the middle at G as shown.  The coefficients of static and kinetic 
friction between the crate and the belt are µ s = 0.60 and µ k = 0.50. 

a)  Determine the largest acceleration that the belt can have in the positive x-direction 

without causing the crate to tip or slip.  (10 marks) 

b)  At t = 0 the belt accelerates from rest with (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)= 5.70 î m/s2 and the crate will begin to 
tip about point Q.  Determine (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:7) and α  for the crate at the instant t = 0.  The moment of 
inertia of the crate about G is: (cid:8)(cid:7) (cid:9)
width.  Note that for the crate at this instant, (cid:17) (cid:9) 0, (cid:19) (cid:20) 0, and point Q does not slip 
relative to the belt.    (10 marks)

Question 4 

A wheel has mass m = 8.0 kg, radius R = 1.2 metres, and radius of gyration k = 0.70 metres.  At 
the instant shown in the diagram, its center of gravity has a speed of 5.9 m/s, as the wheel rolls 
without slipping down the hill.  At the bottom of the hill, it strikes the stationary block B of mass 
5.0 kg; the wheel then stops rolling and sticks to the block B.  The wheel and block then both 
slide to the right together. 

a)  At the instant shown in the diagram, what is the magnitude of the total acceleration of 

point C on the wheel, located at the edge of the wheel where it is touching the ground?   
(5 marks) 

b)  At the instant shown in the diagram, what is the acceleration of the centre of the wheel, in 

n-t coordinates?  (5 marks) 

c)  What will be the speed of the centre of the wheel after the wheel has decreased its 
elevation by 2.5 metres, just before the wheel strikes the block B?  (5 marks) 

d)  What will be the speed of the block and wheel immediately following the collision, as 

they slide to the right stuck together?  (5 marks)
