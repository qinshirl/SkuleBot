cuprous oxide:   Cu2O (also known as Copper (I) Oxide)

Now consider pure cupric oxide which is exposed to a reducing atmosphere at an elevated 
temperature, and as a result some of the Cu2+ ion become Cu+.

Name two possible defects that can form in order to maintain charge neutrality. [4 pts] 

(ii) 

  For each of the defects identified in part (i), how many Cu+ ions are required? [1 pts]

QUESTION 2: (10 pts) 

A.  A single crystal of silver is oriented such that a 

tensile stress is applied along a [001] direction, as 
illustrated in the diagram on the right. Slip occurs on 
a (111) plane and in the direction 
. The critical 
resolved shear stress is 0.45 MPa. Calculate the yield 
stress for silver. [6 pts] 

B.  True or False? Circle the correct answer. [4 pts]  

(i)  Generally, a fine-grained (i.e., small-grained) material is harder and stronger than a coarse-

grained material.  

(ii) Alloying with impurity atoms which go into substitutional or interstitial solid solution is not a 
strengthening mechanism as these impurity atoms do not typically impose lattice strains on the 
surrounding host. 

TRUE        FALSE 
(iii)Edge dislocations of the same sign ( +  ) and lying on the same slip plane will exert a mutually 
attractive force and upon meeting they will annihilate each other, thus rendering a region of 
perfect crystal. 

TRUE        FALSE 

TRUE        FALSE 

(iv) Cold working of 8mm diameter flexible copper pipe makes it harder and stronger. 

TRUE        FALSE
