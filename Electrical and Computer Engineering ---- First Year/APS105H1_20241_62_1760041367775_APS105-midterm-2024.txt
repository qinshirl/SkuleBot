Examiners: S. Emara, J. Eyolfson, B. Korst

This is a “closed book” examination; no aids are permitted. No calculators or
other electronic devices are allowed.

All questions are to be answered on the examination paper. If the space pro-
vided for a question is insufficient, you may use the last page to complete
your answer. If you use the last page, please direct the marker to that page
and indicate clearly on that page which question(s) you are answering there.

You must use the C language to answer programming questions. You are not
required write #include directives in your solutions.

Note that the summary of the total marks for the questions and the marks
given for the questions is on the last page.

The examination has 18 pages, including this one.

Question 1 [3 Marks]
Write a single C statement that declares a bool called isValidIndex and ini-
tializes its value to true if and only if an integer, index, is a valid index within
an array of size, arrayLength.

Please write your answer here:

2

Question 2 [3 Marks]
Write a single C statement that declares a bool variable named myBool and
sets its value to true if and only if the value stored in an integer variable
named myInt is an even negative number. You may assume that the variable
myInt has been declared and initialized already to some value.

Please write your answer here:

3

Question 3 [3 Marks]
Write a single C statement that declares an int variable called randomNum and
sets it to a random number that is a multiple of 5 and is between 5 and 25
(inclusive). This means that randomNum should be set to either: 5, 10, 15, 20 or
25. You may use the rand() function.

Please write your answer here:

4

Question 4 [3 Marks]
The following C function takes a single integer argument, grade, that repre-
sents a grade between 0 and 100 (inclusive) and prints a letter grade. You
decide to test the program by calling printLetterGrade(75), what output
would you see as a result?

void printLetterGrade(int grade) {

if (grade >= 80) {
printf("A\n");

}
if (grade >= 70) {
printf("B\n");

}
if (grade >= 60) {
printf("C\n");

}
if (grade >= 50) {
printf("D\n");

}
else {

printf("F\n");

}

}

Question 5 [5 Marks]

Indicate whether the statements below are True or False by circling the cor-
rect choice.

1. The operator == can be used to assign a value to a variable.

True

False

2. It is valid to dereference an uninitialized pointer.

True

False

3. A boolean variable is typically stored using 1 byte.

True

False

4. If arr is an array of integers and p is a pointer to int variable, then

*p == a[0] assigns the first value of the array to p.
True

False

5. One of the roles of the compiler is to indicate logic errors in C language.

True

False

6. The sizeof(double) expression returns the size in bytes of data type

double.
True

False

7. In functions, "pass by value" refers to the process where the function
receives a direct link to the original parameter, rather than a copy of its
value.
True

False

8. After the declaration of an array, the name of the array itself is a pointer

to the first element of the array.
True

False

9. When an array is used as an argument in a function call, a copy of that

array is passed to the function.
True

False

10. The function rand() needs a different "seed" every time you run your

program to generate truly random numbers.
True

False

Question 6 [8 Marks]

What’s the output of the following program?

int main(void) {
int first = 1;
int arr[4] = {5, 10, 15, 20};
int* p = arr + 1, *q = arr + 3;
int* s = &first;
*s = q - p;

arr[first] = (*arr) + 2;

*q = *p + 5;

(*p)++;

printf("first = %d\n", first);
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
printf("%d, ", *(arr + i));

}

return 0;

}

Question 7 [7 Marks]

Write a C main function that takes in two dates from the user, and determines
if the first date or the second date is later or if they are the same date. Three
examples are shown below. User input is in bold.

Example 1:
Enter first date (day/month): 22/10
Enter second date (day/month): 1/10
First date is later

Example 2:
Enter first date (day/month): 22/10
Enter second date (day/month): 22/11
Second date is later

Example 3:
Enter first date (day/month): 22/10
Enter second date (day/month): 22/10
It’s the same date

int main(void) {

Question 8 [8 Marks]
Write a complete C function called sumDivisors, the prototype of which is
given below, that accepts one parameter named num of type int. The function
must return the sum of all divisors of num. You may assume that the argument
passed to the function is a positive integer. For example, if num was 6, the
divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3. The function should return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. The divisors
do not include the number itself, but they include 1.

int sumDivisors(int num) {

Question 9 [10 Marks]
Write a C function named secondLargest that takes two arguments: an array
of positive integers and the size of the array. The function should return the
second largest element in the array. Assume that the array always has at least
two elements. For example, given the array {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5,
3, 5} with length 11, the function should return 6. If all elements have the
same value, the function should return 0.

int secondLargest(int array[], int arrayLength) {

Question 10 [12 Marks]

Write a C main function that takes in the number of lines, and prints the
following pattern depending on the number of lines entered by the user.

Example 1

Enter number of lines: 5
*****
* *
*
* *
*****

Example 2

Enter number of lines: 6
******
* *
**
**
* *
******

int main(void) {

Question 11 [13 Marks]
Write a complete C function called arrayInArray, the prototype of which is
given below. The function accepts two arrays of type int as parameters,
named a and b. The sizes of b and a are unknown, but the last element in
both array is always -1. All other elements in the arrays are positive integers.
The function must return true if the sequence of numbers in array b is found
in array a excluding the last element in the array, which is always -1.

For example, if a = {6, 8, 7, 6, 1, 7, 4, -1} and b = {6, 1, -1}, the
function returns true as the sequence of {6, 1} is available in a at index 3.

Another example, if a = {6, 8, 7, 6, 1, 7, 4, -1} and b = {7, 8, -1},
the function returns false as the sequence of {7, 8} is not available in a.

bool arrayInArray(int a[], int b[]) {
