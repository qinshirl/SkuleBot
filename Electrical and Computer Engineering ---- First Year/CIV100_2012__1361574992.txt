3.  A truss structure is supported by one roller 

and one pin and subjected to four point loads 
as shown.  

A  

i.) Assuming that the truss members have a 
mass per unit length of 20 kg/m and g=10 
m/s2 for simplicity, locate the centre of mass 
with reference to origin and show it on a new 
sketch. Ignore all point loads shown.

ii.)  Determine the support reactions due to the self-weight of the truss. Ignore all point loads shown. 

iii.)Using the method of sections, determine the internal forces of members BD, CD, CO, DF and OF.
  Use a new FBD. Indicate whether the members are in compression or tension. Neglect the self-
  weight of the members.
