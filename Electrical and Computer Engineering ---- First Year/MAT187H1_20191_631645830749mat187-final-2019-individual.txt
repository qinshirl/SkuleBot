LONG ANSWER PART

11. You work for a roller coaster construction company and Canada’s Wonderland

(21 marks)

is asking you to design a new ride. Your job is to design a speciﬁc part of the ride.

The trajectory should follow the curve given by

in metres,

for 0 (cid:54) t (cid:54) 10 seconds.

Consider parts (b)–(d) as independent.

(a) (1 mark) Show that (cid:126)r (cid:48)(t) = (cid:104)b cos(t2), c, b sin(t2)(cid:105).

(b) (6 marks) Riders should never exceed a speed of 50 m/s. What are the restrictions on b and

c? Your answer should not include t. Justify your answer.

(c) (6 marks) Taking safety and durability into account, the curvature should not exceed 1

10 m−1.
What are the restrictions on b and c? Your answer should not include t. Justify your answer.

Note. For this question, do not use the restrictions that you found in (b).

(d) (6 marks) The roller coaster should exert a maximum acceleration of 40 m/s2 in the normal

direction. What are the restrictions on b and c? Your answer should not include t. Justify your

answer.

Note. For this question, do not use the restrictions that you found in (b) and (c).

(e) (2 marks) Give one possible pair of values b (cid:54)= 0 and c (cid:54)= 0 that fulﬁl all the above design

requirements. Your answer should not include t. Justify your answer.

12. A scientist wants to study the growth of the trunk of a Giant Sequoia. Assume

(19 marks)

the trunk has a circular cross section with radius r(y) at the height of y and the

total height of the tree is H (all units in metres).

(a) (7 marks) Assume that a Giant Sequoia’s trunk is 50% water, uniformly

distributed throughout the trunk.

Show that the work it took for the tree to bring water from the ground to ﬁll

the whole trunk was

W =

(cid:90) H

y r2(y) dy,

π ρ g

0
where ρ is the mass density of water (in kg/m3) and g is the acceleration due

to gravity.

Your answer should not include just formulas, but also a step-by-step expla-

nation about how the formulas were obtained.

Hint. Within a thin slice of the trunk as shown in the ﬁgure, work can be

approximated as force times displacement.

(b) (6 marks) The scientist took some measurements of the tree:

• The tree is 18 m high.

radius r

height y

radius r

• Measurements for the radius are given in the

table on the right (all units are in metres).

• The function yr2(y) is increasing for y (cid:54) 2.

• The function yr2(y) is decreasing for y (cid:62) 2.

She wants to make sure to overestimate the work calculated in (a).

Approximate as best as you can with the data available while making sure to overestimate it.

As before, don’t give just formulas, but also explain all your decisions and procedures.

You don’t have a calculator, so leave your answer unsimpliﬁed.

W ≈

(c) (6 marks) The scientist met with a statistician who analyzed the data and deduced that the

shape of the tree is very well approximated by r(y) = 3y−1.2

for y (cid:62) 2.

Ignoring other physical constraints, can the tree grow inﬁnitely tall and still need only a ﬁnite

amount of work to bring water to the whole trunk? Justify your answer.

13. In this question we will study the continuity of a parameter of a second-order

(20 marks)

ordinary diﬀerential equation.

(a) (6 marks) Find the solution x(t) of


x(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) − 2x(cid:48)(t) + x(t) = 0

x(0) = 0

x(cid:48)(0) = 1

Justify your answer.

x(t) =

(b) (7 marks) Consider the initial-value problem

h(t) + (1 − h2)xh(t) = 0


h(t) − 2x(cid:48)
x(cid:48)(cid:48)

xh(0) = 0

x(cid:48)
h(0) = 1

Assume h > 0. Find the solution xh(t). Justify your answer.

Hint. For this part only, you can assume h > 0 is a constant.

xh(t) =

(c) (5 marks) Use your answer from (b) and ﬁnd the limit lim
h→0

xh(t). Justify your answer.

lim
h→0

xh(t) =

(d) (2 marks) Compare the results of questions (a) and (c). What do you observe?
