APS111 & APS113 – 2012 – Midterm Vocabulary List 

We will assume that you know, and can answer questions about, the terms that appear 
in the textbook and readings or that have appeared in lecture.  

The following is a list of some additional words you may find on the Midterm. It does not 
include all of the words on the exam, and some of these words will not appear on the 
exam. Words that have been specifically defined or discussed in lecture are not listed. 
However, familiarity with these words will help you move more quickly through the 
exam. You should also be familiar with their plural form, past tense form, etc. If you 
already have a good understanding of the common meaning of these words, then there 
is no need to look them up in a dictionary, or spend any additional time studying them.
