9.  You have invented a new pogo type of pogo stick (a bouncing toy) that relies on a 

magnetic spring arrangement.  You are in the process of filing a patent and discover 
a 1991 patent that describes the same basic invention.  

a)  You will not be granted a patent because your invention was known in the prior 

art.  

b)  You cannot make the new pogo stick because you will be infringing on the 1991 

patent.  

c)  You cannot make the new pogo stick because it will still be covered under 

copyright.  

d)  You may file a patent if you can prove that you invented the pogo stick prior to 

discovering the earlier patent.  

e)  The answer depends on whether or not the original patent has been renewed by 

the inventor for a second 20-year term. 

10. The Industrial Design act of Canada.   

a)  Provides a set of safety standards covering all industries in Canada. 
b)  Provides guidance for the design of complex scheduling systems. 
c)  Certifies that engineers are qualified designers and can practice engineering. 
d)  Describes the conditions under which the visual design of an object can be 

protected by a design patent.  

11.  An advantage of the Pugh Selection Process over a weighted decision matrix is that: 

a)  It provides a more quantitative method of comparing alternatives.  
b)  It is based on just one key objective and is therefore more decisive.  
c)  It takes advantage of the fact that humans are better at relative comparisons 

than absolute judgments.  

d)  It is based entirely on a set of codes and standards and thus makes use of the 

experience of past designers.  

12.   A commissioning engineer is most often responsible for 

a)  Calculating the commission of sales engineers. 
b)  Checking that a new facility such as a chemical plant or building is working as 

specified in the contract on behalf of the owner.  

c)  Reviewing the initial contract on behalf of the design/build firm. 
d)  Checking for compliance with codes and standards on behalf of the government.
