1. Bar EF has a square cross-section and is fixed in space. The structure ABC has negligible weight and 
has a collar at C which has a square hole, that slides freely on bar EF. The structure ABC supports a 
uniform rectangular sign having a weight of 1 kN, acting at the centre of the sign. The vertical edges of 
the sign align vertically with points A and B. Determine the magnitude of the force in cable AD and all the 
reaction components at C.

2. A man supports himself and the uniform, horizontal beam AB, having a rough surface, by pulling on the 
rope with a force T. The mass of the man is 90 kg and that of the beam is 5.2 kg/m. The total weight of the 
beam acts at the mid-span of the beam. Compute the tension, T, in the rope and the reaction force 
components at the pin at A. In addition, calculate the distance b, locating the man’s feet, and determine the 
forces exerted on the man by the beam.

3. The bracket illustrated is subjected to three cable forces, as indicated. Determine an equivalent force 
system consisting of a single resultant force and determine the x-coordinate of the point where its line of 
action intersect the x-axis.
