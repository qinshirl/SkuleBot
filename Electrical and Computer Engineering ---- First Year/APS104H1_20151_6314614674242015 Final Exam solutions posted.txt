Strain

Stress-strain behavior of a bronze alloy specimen. 

3a. What is the maximum load that can be sustained by the specimen?  F = 319000N 

3b.  Determine  the  maximum  load  that  may  be  applied  to  the  bronze  alloy  specimen  without  plastic 
deformation.  

3c. Determine the specimen cross-sectional area when the specimen is pulled in tension with a force of 
200 000 N.  

3d. What is the ductility, in percent of elongation?  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
	
3e. Determine the modulus of resilience (Ur).  
Ur=0.5 (stress*strain)=0.5(575 MPa)(0.03)=8.625 MPa 

3f. Select the correct answer:  

i. 
ii. 

iii. 

Brittle materials generally never exhibit higher tensile strengths than ductile materials 
During  plastic  deformation,  the  bonds  between  original  atom  neighbors  are  broken 
and new bonds are formed.  
Ceramics  typically  absorb  large  amount  of  energy  than  metal  before  their  catastrophic 
fracture. 

iv.  When porosity increases, the flexural strength also increases accordingly.
