Read each question carefully. All questions should be answered directly 
in this booklet in the box provided. 
If you need scrap paper for draft work ask an invigilator. 
Write in complete sentences and complete paragraphs were applicable. 
Marks for each question are indicated in square brackets [].

1. Circle T (TRUE.) or F (False) for each statement below. If the answer is FALSE, then 
rewrite the entire statement to make the statement TRUE. There may be multiple 
ways to do this, just pick one, [1 Mark each; total 10 Marks] 

'H 

[T or F]: In the design process, you do research to investigate existing knowledge 
and to develop new knowledge. 

[T or F]: The purpose of the Project Requirements (PR) is to define the design. 

[T or F]: Use idea generation techniques to counter your bias and design fixation. 

[T or F]: Idea selection defines the client's need by specifying the boundaries of the 
design problem. 

[T or F]: Considering the most-to-least method to prevent negative environmental 
impact, an engineering designer would: Reuse, Reduce, Recycle. 

[T or F]: A Life Cycle Diagram is a way to visualize potential environmental impacts. 

[T or F]: Elon Musk was talking about environmental design when he said, 'Any 
product that needs a manual to work is broken." 

[T or F]: Monthly rent is an example of an external cost. 

[T or F]: Means is what the design must do. 

[T or F]: A constraint goal is what the design tries to meet.

In developing the next iteration of a document, you should apply "CPR'. State what 
this is and how to apply it. [3 Marks] 

The Fry Shack, a new restaurant, contracts you to recommend which French Fry fryer 
to buy. They have narrowed it down to two options. Based on an economic analysis 
which fryer to maintain a cock rate of 1 order of fries per minute? [4 Marks]

Questions 4 to 19 pertain to the Request for Proposal (RFP) Drill Bit Sorter 

Write a Functional Basis for the problem described in the RFP. Use the specific terms 
discussed in lecture and no additional qualifiers. [2 Marks] 

Write a Problem Statement for the RFP. [10 Marks] 

7. Write three Objectives complete with metrics and goals. [6 Marks]

9 Write two Constraints complete with limits [4 Marks] 

10. Identify one relevant Stakeholder and their interest. Provide either one Function, 

Objective, or Constraint (FOC) that could be derived from their interest. This can be 
the same FOC determined elsewhere in the exam, but you must clearly indicate how it 
is derived from the Stakeholder interest. [3 Marks] 

Identify one specific aspect of the Service Environment (no reference needed, just 
draw upon your own engineering expertise). Provide one FOC that could be derived 
from this aspect. This can be the same FOC determined elsewhere in the exam, but 
you must clearly indicate how it is derived from the Service Environment. [2 Marks] 

Write one closed question you would ask the client in the first meeting to help you 
determine FOC's.  11  Mark]

were used to generate the ideas. The more creative, innovative and distinctly different 
the aooroaches the more Marks you will receive. 110 Marks] 

14. Use a Weighted Decision Matrix and the three Objectives you generated to 

recommend one of your design alternatives. [10 Marks]

'H 

explaining how it is linked to the 3 R's. [3 Marks] 

If you were presenting the feature in Q. 15 or 16 to the client in an oral presentation, 
what would be the header on the slide? [2 Marks] 

If you were really doing this case study project, you would need to do research. Give 
three examples of research questions/areas you need to investigate and the type of 
source that would provide the credible information. [6 Marks] 

Using the language of the course, what does Figure 3 in the RFP represent? As an 
engineering designer what danger does it pose to your design process? [2 Marks]
