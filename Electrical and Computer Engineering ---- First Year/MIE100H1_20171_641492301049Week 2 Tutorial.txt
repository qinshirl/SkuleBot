MIE100S – Winter 2017  
Tutorial Problem 02a 

A  baseball  player  releases  a  ball  with  an  initial 
velocity of 35 m/s at an angle 35o with the horizontal. 
If  t=0  is  the  time  of  release  from  the  player’s  hand, 
determine the rate of change of the speed, at t=1s.  

Hint: the rate of change of speed occurs along the line 
of  the  path  (at).  Use  geometry  to  find  the  direction 
along the path.

Tutorial Problem 02b 

From MIE 100 Dynamics Midterm 2005 

A point mass is located at                  m with respect to a given set of rectangular axes.  
Following is some information about its motion: 

        m/s, 

       m/s, 

        m/s2, 

       m/s2 

Find: 

(i)  The speed of the particle. 
(ii) The velocity of the particle, expressed in normal-tangential coordinates.  
(iii) The tangential acceleration     
(iv) The radius of curvature of the particle's path,  .  
(v) Sketch the direction of    .
