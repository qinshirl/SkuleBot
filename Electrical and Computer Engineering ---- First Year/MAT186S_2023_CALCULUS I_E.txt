The final exam contains 17 pages. DO NOT DETACH ANY PAGES FROM THIS TEST.

The backside of the pages WILL NOT be scanned nor graded. Use the back side of pages for rough 
work only.

Cellphones, smartwatches, or any other electronic devices are not permitted. They must be turned 
off and in your bag under your desk or chair. These devices are NOT to be in your pockets and 
CANNOT BE TAKEN TO THE WASHROOM.

Show all your work and justify your steps on every question unless otherwise indicated. A cor­
rect answer without explanation will receive no credit unless otherwise notes; an incorrect answer 
supported by substantially correct calculations and explanations may receive partial credit.

6. You must use the methods learned in this course to solve all the problems.

Perform all the steps we outlined to sketch the curve with calculus, and then sketch the curve. 
This includes listing the domain, any asymptotes, intervals of increase/decrease with justification, 
intervals of concavity with justification, and along with the sketch plotting and labehng any critical 
numbers, points of inflection, and intercepts. Make sure to justify relative extrema using the first 
or second derivative test. [12 marks]

Domain:

Therefore, the domain is 

Intercepts:

Therefore,

we have the 3/-intercept(s)

and a:-intercept(s)

Asymptotes:

This gives vertical asymptote(s)

and horizontal asymptote(s)

Critical Points and Increasing/Decreasing Intervals:

12

We have the critical point(s)

f (a:) is increasing on the interval

/(x) is decreasing on the interval

Points of Inflection and Concavity Intervals:
