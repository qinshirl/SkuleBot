Cooling Fins

Modules: E1-E4

For a body with total surface area 𝐴𝑠 and uniform surface temperature 𝑇𝑠, the instantaneous rate of convective
heat transfer out of the body is modeled by Newton’s law of cooling:

̇𝑄conv = ℎ𝐴𝑠(𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇∞)
where ℎ is a constant and 𝑇∞ is the ambient temperature (temperature of the room). The units are as follows:

̇𝑄conv ∶ Watts
ℎ ∶ Watts/(meters squared ⋅ degrees Kelvin)
𝐴𝑠 ∶ meters squared
(𝑇𝑠 − 𝑇∞) ∶ degrees Kelvin

What if we extended this model a bit? Say we constructed a cooling fin shaped as a solid of revolution. Let our
fin be the solid created when the area between a function 𝑟(𝑥) and the 𝑥 axis between 𝑥 = 0 to 𝑥 = 𝐿 is revolved
around the 𝑥-axis. All distances are in meters. As a simplifying assumption, suppose the surface temperature
of the fin 𝑇𝑠 = 𝑇𝑠(𝑥) depends only on the horizontal distance from the origin (note this is no longer a uniform
surface temperature). We want to find an expression for the instantaneous rate of convective heat transfer out
of our entire cooling fin,

̇𝑄conv.

1. Explain a plan to break this problem up into parts, providing the notation you will use.
2. Explain how you are approximating ̇𝑄conv on one of your individual parts. Be specific in explaining what
is being approximated by what, and any choices you are making. Units are an important part of this
explanation.

3. Add up your approximations to come up with an expression for the approximate value of

̇𝑄conv for the

whole fin.

4. Use your answer to the previous part to explain how to obtain a definite integral formula for the ̇𝑄conv for

the whole fin; use appropriate mathematical notation to relate the two.

Your answer to this problem will involve the functions 𝑟(𝑥) and 𝑇𝑠(𝑥) as well as the constants ℎ, 𝑇∞, and 𝐿. You
should not assume 𝑟(𝑥) looks as pictured below.

Writing is confusing, or shows
signs of carelessness through high
level of error; does not
demonstrate application of
engineering communication; only
understandable to the writer.

Math is presented without
context; it is difficult to
reconstruct the meaning of
equations.

No demonstration of any
significant level of mathematical
analysis at an appropriate level.
No serious attempt to apply
mathematics.

(1)

Meets ex-
pectations
(2)

While the writing is clear, the
math is kept completely separate
from it; requires some effort to
understand how the math and
writing are connected.

A serious attempt is made to apply
appropriate math and explain
mathematical reasoning,
regardless of completeness or
correctness.

Writing requires some effort to
understand, or has some errors
rarely affecting understanding;
some evidence of communication
principles but may be awkward or
simplistic; offers sufficient
information and demonstrates
mostly logical development of
ideas; generally directed to the
instructor or TA.

Writing shows appropriate
selection and balance of text and
image (if necessary); demonstrates
clarity at the paragraph, sentence,
and word choice levels, with
minimal error; writing applies
principles in ways that enhance
the reading experience; generally
directed towards a fellow student
who understands the math but
not this particular instance.

The interaction of the text with
the math is adequate; any
transitions between math and text
are appropriately placed and
make sense; any equations and
variables are introduced and
explained in an organized manner;
any solutions are interpreted in a
real-world context where
appropriate; no guesswork is
needed by the reader.

The response shows a good ability
to analyze a situation using math;
relevant topics are applied with
proper notation; any solutions are
critically analyzed for sensibility;
any obviously incorrect solutions
are remarked upon and followed
up with a sketch of an alternative
idea or plan.

bonus (3)

The writing demonstrates
professional polish through word
choice, sentence structure choices,
clarity, concision, proofreading,
etc. This solution is presentable as
a textbook example or exposition.

The math is merged very well with
the writing; any equations and
variables are embedded, clear, and
concise; any transitions between
text and mathematics aid
understanding; any solutions are
contextualized and explained in a
professional manner.

The analysis is excellent, creating
a large amount of insight into the
prompt and demonstrates
mastery of the topic at or above
the course level.
