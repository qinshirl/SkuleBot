9. Let T (t) denote the temperature (measured in ◦C) of a cup of tea at time t (measured in minutes). Suppose you are
given that the temperature of a cup of tea, cooling oﬀ in a room with surrounding temperature of 20◦C, is modelled by

dT
dt

= −0.05(T − 20)

(a) Use the linear approximation to estimate the temperature of a cup of tea 48 seconds after the temperature is 70◦C.
[2 marks]

We seek to use linear approximation to estimate the temperature of the cup of tea (after 48 seconds), which is modeled as
the solution to the above ODE. First of all, we deﬁne t = 0 to be the instant of time where we know the temperature is
70◦C. Now notice that there is a disagreement between the time units used in the diﬀerential equation (minutes) and the
time at which we want to estimate the temperature (seconds). However, note that 48 seconds = 4
5 minutes, and so the
problem translates into estimating said temperature at t = 4
5 minutes. That being said, let us recall the general formula
for the linear approximation around t = 0, evaluated at some time t∗,

T (t∗) ≈ T (0) + T (cid:48)(0)(cid:0)t∗ − 0(cid:1).

The reason for using a linear approximation of T (t) around t = 0 (instead of around t = something else) is because t = 0
is the only point for which we have additional information about the solution, namely, T (0). Then, it is enough to ﬁnd
the values of T (cid:48)(0), keeping in mind that t∗ = 48 seconds = 4
5 minutes, and that T (0) = 70◦C. However, in order to ﬁnd
said value it is enough to evaluate the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by T at t = 0, from where we get that

T (cid:48)(0) = − 1
20

(cid:0)T (0) − 20(cid:1) = − 1

20

(cid:0)70 − 20(cid:1) = − 5
2 .

Gathering all the above information, we can now use the linear approximation formula to obtain that, after 48 seconds,
the temperature of the cup of tea is approximately,

T ( 4

5 ) ≈ T (0) + T (cid:48)(0)(cid:0) 4

(b) Is your answer in part (a) an underestimation or overestimation of the actual temperature 12 seconds after the tem-
perature is 70◦C. [3 marks: 1 mark for correct ﬁnal answer; 2 marks for justiﬁcation]

Underestimation.

(cid:13) Overestimation.

Generally speaking we know that a linear approximation of a function f (x) will overestimate its exact value if f (x) is
concave down, and underestimate it if f (x) is concave up around the study point, and so the question comes down to
knowing whether f (x) is concave up or down.
In the present case we can calculate the second derivative of T (t) by
diﬀerentiating the given ODE above,

T (cid:48)(cid:48)(t) =

d
dt

T (cid:48)(t) =

(cid:16)

d
dt

− 0.05(T − 20)

(cid:17)

= −0.05T (cid:48)(t) = (0.05)2(T − 20).

Thus, noticing that T (t) > 20 for all t ∈ [0, 4
T (t) is concave up on said interval, and hence the above linear approximation corresponds to an underestimate.

5 ], we deduce that T (cid:48)(cid:48)(t) = (0.05)2(T − 20) > 0 for all t ∈ [0, 4

5 ]. Therefore,

Note: you do not need to know the formula for the area of a trapezoid to do this problem. You can use the picture to
express the area of the trapezoid in question as the sum of the area of a rectangle (of length a and width h) and the areas
of two right triangles (of height h and base width x−a

Suppose we chose x to be our design variable, so we optimize f (x). We use the Closed Interval Method, so we start by
testing the endpoints:

In particular, x = 3a is out of the race immediately. We then have to compute the critical points of f (x):

f (a) = a2,
f (3a) = 0.

The above is trivially simpliﬁed to obtain

Since we do not allow x = −a, the only critical point here is

0 = x2 − ax − 2a2 = (x − 2a)(x + a).

We ﬁnd that

Alternatively, we could have chosen h to be our design variable. We can still use the Closed Interval Method to ﬁnd

the maximizer. This means we have to test the endpoints ﬁrst. If x ∈ [a, 3a], this means h ∈ [0, a]. We ﬁnd that

f (0) = 0
f (a) = a (a + 0) = a2.

In particular, we can deﬁnitely throw out h = 0 as a candidate for the maximizer!Now, we look for the critical points of
f (h). This requires solving

12. Let f (x) be a twice diﬀerentiable function with f (0) = 0, f (cid:48)(0) = 0 and f (cid:48)(cid:48)(0) = 2. Deﬁne

if x (cid:54)= 0,

if x = 0.

Give a careful, well written argument that shows g(cid:48)(0) = 1. [4 marks]

First of all let’s recall that, by deﬁnition, the derivative of a function g(x) at a point x∗ is given by the formula

g(cid:48)(x∗) = lim
x→x∗

g(x) − g(x∗)
x − x∗

.

Now, by the deﬁnition of g(x) given at the beginning of this question, we already know that g(0) = 0 and that for every
x diﬀerent than 0,

g(x) =

f (x)
x

.

Plugging this information into the deﬁnition of the derivative, we ﬁnd that the derivative of g(x) at x∗ = 0 is given by

g(cid:48)(0) = lim
x→0

where for the last 0
0 limit we have used the fact that f (0) = 0 along with the continuity of f (x) at x = 0 (f (x) is
diﬀerentiable, so it’s in particular continuous), so that f (x) → f (0) = 0 as x → 0. Then, since f (x) is diﬀerentiable, in
order to calculate the above limit we can use L’Hˆopital’s rule, provided that the resulting limit exists. Observe that using
L’Hˆopital’s rule without checking the above conditions (diﬀerentiability of f (x) and the 0
0 limit) represents an unjustiﬁed
use of said rule. Thus, we infer that,

provided the limit of f (cid:48)(x)/2x exists. However, using that f (cid:48)(0) = 0, we can now rewrite the above limit as

g(cid:48)(0) = lim

f (cid:48)(cid:48)(0) = 1,

which is exactly what we used before. Since the resulting limit in equation (3) exists and equals one, we conclude that
the application of L’Hˆopital’s rule was valid, and hence this is in fact the value of g(cid:48)(0).

f (cid:48)(x) − f (cid:48)(0)
x − 0

lim
x→0

= f (cid:48)(cid:48)(0) = 2,

Remark: Some students might have tried to apply L’Hˆopital’s rule a second time after arriving at (2), instead of
identifying the last limit in (3) as the deﬁnition of the derivative of f (cid:48)(x) at x = 0, but the problem with doing this is
that we end up with

g(cid:48)(0) l’H= lim
x→0

f (cid:48)(cid:48)(x)

,

assuming they have justiﬁed that f (cid:48)(x)/2x → 0
0 as x → 0 (which follows from the continuity of f (cid:48)(x) due to the twice
diﬀerentiability of f (x), so that they can ensure that f (cid:48)(x) → 0 as x → 0), and that f (cid:48)(x) is diﬀerentiable, so they
can apply L’Hˆopital’s rule again. However, since we do not know if f (cid:48)(cid:48)(x) is continuous at zero (the fact that f (cid:48)(x) is
diﬀerentiable does not imply that f (cid:48)(cid:48)(x) is continuous), we cannot evaluate the above limit for f (cid:48)(cid:48)(x). More speciﬁcally,
even if f (x) is twice diﬀerentiable and f (cid:48)(cid:48)(0) exists and is equal to 2, the limit

f (cid:48)(cid:48)(x),

lim
x→0

might not exist (due to the lack of continuity of f (cid:48)(cid:48)(x)). Thus, we cannot directly evaluate that limit, plugging f (cid:48)(cid:48)(0) = 2,
to deduce that

g(cid:48)(0) = lim
x→0

(not necessarily true)

Alternative, but incorrect, approach: We noticed that a large portion of the students followed a diﬀerent approach and we
would like to acknowledge them only if they fully and properly justiﬁed their approach. First of all note that one could
directly calculate the derivative of g(x) by using the quotient rule

g(cid:48)(x) =

f (cid:48)(x)x − f (x)
x2

for x (cid:54)= 0.

It is important to remark that this formula holds only if x (cid:54)= 0. Then, assuming the continuity of g(cid:48)(x) at 0 (which
is not given), we could ﬁnd g(cid:48)(0) by taking the limit of the above formula as x → 0, from where we would get that

g(cid:48)(0) = lim
x→0

f (cid:48)(x)x − f (x)

(cid:21)

where for the last 0

0 limit we have used the fact that f (0) = 0 and f (cid:48)(0) = 0, along with the continuity of f (x) and f (cid:48)(x)

f (x) → f (0) = 0

and

f (cid:48)(x) → f (cid:48)(0) = 0

as x → 0. Thus, since f (x) is twice diﬀerentiable, in order to calculate the above limit we can use L’Hˆopital’s rule,
provided that the resulting limit exists. Once again, the problem of using L’Hˆopital’s rule here is that we end up with

g(cid:48)(0) l’H= lim
x→0

f (cid:48)(cid:48)(x)x + f (cid:48)(x) − f (cid:48)(x)
2x

= lim
x→0

f (cid:48)(cid:48)(x)

=

= 1,

that requires assuming the continuity of f (cid:48)(cid:48)(x) at x = 0 (which is not given and leads to the same problems pointed
out in the Remark in pink above).

A large number of students not only assumed all the continuity properties mentioned above but also missed the calculations
for the last limit, making some terms disappear (or appear), taking limits only of some factors but not of the others so that
the limit suddenly became 1. While we would acknowledge incorrect solutions that assumed extra (continuity) hypotheses
and correctly justiﬁed the use of L’Hˆopital’s making up the limit to be 1 by wrong and unjustiﬁed calculations, making
appear numbers or taking limits only of some factors and conveniently making the others disappear would not receive
part marks if the question was to be graded..
