QUESTION 1:  Ideal Gas Law (20 pts) 
20 g of propane (C3H8) is in a 2 L container at 25°C.

L/mol) [4 pts] 

5.182 atm 

c)  calculate the exact number of moles of oxygen needed to burn all the propane according to:

[2 pts] 

2.268 mol 

d)  If  we add the exact number of moles of O2 from part c) into the same 2L container, and 

assuming the reaction in part 1c) takes place completely, calculate the final pressure in the vessel 
assuming: 
•

the temperature rises to 150°C 
•  water remains as water vapor 

[5 pts] 

e)  recalculate the answer in part d) if you start with only half the amount of oxygen calculated in 
part c), and also calculate (in addition to the total pressure) the partial pressures and mole 
fractions of all the remaining gasses. [7 pts]

(a)  In the first process, the gas expands adiabatically and reversibly to 1.00 atm. Calculate the final 

temperature and the work done. [6 pts] 

T = 180.5 K 
W = -659J 

 (b)   In the second process, the gas expands adiabatically against a constant pressure of 1.00 atm. 

Calculate the final temperature and the work done. [6 pts]  

T = 212.9K 

w = -478J 

(a)  In the third process, the gas expands isothermally and reversibly until its volume reaches the same 
value as the final volume in part (a). Determine the value of the final volume and the final pressure 
of this reversible isothermal expansion. [4 pts] 

V = 6.67L  P = 1.65 atm 

(d)  On a P-V diagram, sketch the paths described in (a) and (c). In which process was more work 
performed? On the diagram, shade the area that represents the difference in the work done in process (a) 
and process (c) [4 pts] 

QUESTION 3:  First Law of Thermodynamics (20 pts) 

(a)  The density of liquid water at 100 ̊C is 0.9584 g/cm3, and that of steam at the same temperature 
is 0.000596 g/cm3. If the enthalpy of evaporation of water at atmospheric pressure is 40.63 
kJ/mol, what is ΔU? How much work is done by the system during the evaporation process?  
Hint: Consider calculating molar volumes first. [5 pts] 

Work done by the system = 3.06 kJ (or w = -3.06 kJ) 

ΔU = ΔH − Δ(PV) = 40.63kJ /mol − (1atm)(30.20L)(101.325J / Latm)(1kJ /1000J) = 37.6kJ /mol

(b) Would you expect for the fusion process (ice to water) the difference between  ΔU and ΔH to be 
larger or smaller than the one calculate in (a) for the vaporization process? Explain. [3 pts] 

We would expect the difference between ΔU and ΔH to be really small, as the density difference 
between solid and liquid is much smaller than between liquid and gas. As such the difference 
between molar volumes of those two states would be much smaller, and thus work would be 
much smaller, leading to a negligable difference between ΔU and ΔH. 

(c)  How much heat is required to heat 2 moles of water (ice at -10 ̊C) to gasous water vapour at 

110 ̊C? Sketch the process on a temperature vs heat graph. [6 pts]
