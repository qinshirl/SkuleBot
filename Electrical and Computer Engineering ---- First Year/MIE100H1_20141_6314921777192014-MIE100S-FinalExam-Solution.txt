1.  A person standing firmly at point P pulls on a rope that is attached to ball A of mass  

mA = 20 kg. The ball travels along a curvilinear path parallel to the ground, with initial 
radius 𝑟0 = 10 m, initial o = 0, and initial angular rate of rotation 𝜃0̇  = 0.15 rad/s. Motion 
is in the horizontal plane, and friction is negligible. Assume that both A and B have 
extremely small size. 

The rope from P to A is pulled inward at a constant speed 𝑟̇ = −2.0 m/s. At r = 6.0 m, ball 
A collides with ball B (mB = 25 kg), which is initially at rest.  

(a)  Find the initial angular momentum of ball A about point P, at r = 10 m. 

(b)  Determine the angular acceleration 𝑎𝜃 and the angular velocity 𝜃̇ of ball A at r = 8.0 m.  

(c)  Determine the magnitude of the tension in the rope PA when r = 7.0 m, if the angular 

velocity is 𝜃̇ = 0.31 rad/s at that time.  

(d) 

If A stops completely after hitting B at r = 6.0 m, what is the speed of B (𝑣𝐵

2.   Point C has a velocity of -1.2 𝑖 ̇̂ m/s, and an acceleration of -1.4 𝑖 ̇̂ m/s2 at the instant shown 

in the diagram. Bar BC is pinned to bar AB at point B, and bar AB is pinned to the ground at 
point A, as shown in the diagram. One end of bar BC is sliding on a brick wall as shown in 
the diagram. Use the given coordinate system and sign conventions.

from rest on a frictionless surface in the position shown. Use the given coordinate system 
and sign conventions. 

(a)  Draw a free body diagram of the rod just after its release. 
(b)  Find the relationship between the acceleration of the center of mass 𝑎𝐺⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ of the rod and the

4.  A sphere with mass m = 0.1 kg, radius R = 0.2 metres, and radius of gyration kG = 0.1264 

metres sits at rest on the ground. The coefficients of friction between the sphere and the 
ground are µS = 0.4 and µK = 0.2. Neglect air friction.  

The sphere is struck with a constant impact force of 3 N at a distance 0.25 metres above the 
ground as shown in the figure. The impact lasts 0.05 seconds. The sphere then rolls 
horizontally on the ground for 0.5 m, and then up a ramp, as shown.  

Use the given coordinate system and sign conventions. 

a)  Prove that the wheel will roll without slip during the impact by the 3 N force. 
b)  Find the velocity of the sphere’s centre of mass immediately after impact. 
c)  How much work is done by friction on the sphere when it rolls horizontally on the ground 

for 0.5 m? 

d)  What is h, the maximum height that the sphere’s centre of mass reaches, measured from the 

ground as shown?

5.    The block B has a mass of 4 kg, and is suspended between the floor and ceiling as shown in 

the diagram. The position of the block is y = 0 when the block is at rest.  
k1 = 10 N/m; k2 = 20 N/m; k3 = 30 N/m. Ignore any rotation of the block.

(b)   Let C = 14 N.s/m, and the amplitude of oscillation be equal to 0.75 m at time t = 0.  Find the 

amplitude of oscillation at t = 2.5 seconds.    

(c)   A force 𝐹⃗ = 12 𝑗̂ sin(5𝑡) Newtons is applied to block B, where t is time measured in 

seconds. Find the amplitude of oscillation of block B, if C = 0 N.s/m. 

(d)   For part (c), find the frequency of oscillation in cycles per second.
