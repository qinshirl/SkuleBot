Quiz 2 

1.  Solve for 𝒙 if 

𝟐𝒙𝟑 + 𝟑𝒙𝟐 + 𝒙 − 𝟒
𝟐𝒙 − 𝟑

≤ 𝟐 

I messed up on this one.  The factoring for the numerator does not work. 

There  will  be  plenty  more  opportunities  to  demonstrate  your  knowledge  on  the  attributes  attached  to  this 
question, so we just used the question to see if we could find a few marks for (a) showing attempts at factoring 
and (b) knowing to bring the two sides together and then take a common denominator, rather than multiplying. 

The marks for question 1 will not have a negative effect on anyone’s grades. 

2.  Solve for all 𝜽 for which 𝐜𝐨𝐬(𝟐𝜽) = 𝟏.

There are two options here. 

Method I: Solve for 2𝜃. 

We can use the unit circle, with 𝑥 = 1 because we are looking at cosine. 

This gives us 2𝜃 = 2𝜋𝑘. 

Dividing by two, we get our answer: 

𝜃 = 𝜋𝑘, 𝑘 ∈ ℤ 

Method II: Double-angle formula. 

The given equation becomes 2 cos2 𝜃 − 1 = 1 (or we can use 1 − 2 sin2 𝜃 = 1) 

This simplifies to cos2 𝜃 = 1, or cos 𝜃 = ±1. 

Returning to the unit circle, we have all of the multiples of 𝜋, which is the same as the answer above.

3.  Solve for 𝒙 if 𝐥𝐨𝐠𝟓(𝟑𝒙 + 𝟐) = 𝟏 − 𝐥𝐨𝐠𝟓(𝟐𝒙 + 𝟏). 

It’s probably best to get the two logarithms together.

AB3 

log5(3𝑥 + 2) + log5(2𝑥 + 1) = 1 

log5(3𝑥 + 2)(2𝑥 + 1) = 1 

(3𝑥 + 2)(2𝑥 + 1) = 51 

6𝑥2 + 7𝑥 + 2 = 5 

6𝑥2 + 7𝑥 − 3 = 0 

(3𝑥 − 1)(2𝑥 + 3) = 0 

𝑥 = 1/3 or 𝑥 = −3/2 are the results, but the second one needs to be removed, as it leads to logarithms of 
negative numbers.  So, 𝑥 = 1/3 is the only solution.
