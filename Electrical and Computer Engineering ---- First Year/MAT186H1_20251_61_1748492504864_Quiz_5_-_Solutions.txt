We need to look at the numerator as 𝑥 approaches 2.  Notice that the polynomial has two roots and 
so we can be more precise about where it is positive and where it is negative over the entire number 
line, but all we actually need is what happens near 𝑥 = 2. 

|3𝑥2 − 5𝑥 − 2| = |(𝑥 − 2)(3𝑥 + 1)| 

= {

(𝑥 − 2)(3𝑥 + 1),
𝑥 > 2 𝑏𝑦 𝑎 𝑏𝑖𝑡
−(𝑥 − 2)(3𝑥 + 1), 𝑥 < 2 𝑏𝑦 𝑎 𝑏𝑖𝑡

Therefore, we can break up the limit into one-sided limits: 

|3𝑥2 − 5𝑥 − 2|
𝑥2 − 4𝑥 + 4

lim
𝑥→2+

  = lim
𝑥→2+

(𝑥 − 2)(3𝑥 + 1)

The two sides are equal, so the two-sided limit is equal to +∞.

3.  Find the tangent line to 𝑥2𝑦 + ln2[(𝑥 + 2𝑦)3] = 3 + 3𝑥 + 𝑦 at (−1,1). 

4.   A lamp of 8 foot height is standing on one side of a narrow street. On the opposite side, a 6 foot  

tall person is walking at a rate of 3 feet per second. If the street is 8 feet 
across, how fast is the person’s shadow lengthening two seconds 
after walking directly across from the lamp?

The diagram above 
note that it is three-dimensional, so we need to take a couple of cross-sections.   

shows the situation – 

First, we have the 𝑥𝑦 − plane (the street itself): there is a right-angle triangle on the road, with a height (the 
width of the road) of 8, the distance between the person and the point opposite the lamppost (a variable 𝑥), 

and the distance between the post and the man, 𝑎.  We will evaluate these with the data that 

𝑑𝑥
𝑑𝑡

= 3 and 𝑥 =

3

𝑓𝑡
𝑠𝑒𝑐

⋅ 2 𝑠𝑒𝑐 =  6 𝑓𝑡. 

So, 82 + 𝑥2 = 𝑎2.  We can take a derivative with respect to time, 𝒕, to get: 

0 + 2𝑥

𝑑𝑥
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑎
𝑑𝑡

= 2𝑎

𝑑𝑎
𝑑𝑡

= (

𝑥
𝑎

) ⋅

𝑑𝑥
𝑑𝑡

At two seconds, we have 𝑎2 = 64 + 36 = 100, so 𝑎 = 10 and 

𝑑𝑎
𝑑𝑡

=

6
10

⋅ 3 =

. 

Meanwhile, we also have the vertical cross-section that includes the post and the person.  This plane has two 
similar triangles (poorly drawn above and to the right).  One is the triangle whose height is the person and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
base is the shadow; the other has the lamppost as its height, and with a base equal to the shadow plus the 
distance between the person and the post (i.e., 𝑎 + 𝑏).  We have:
