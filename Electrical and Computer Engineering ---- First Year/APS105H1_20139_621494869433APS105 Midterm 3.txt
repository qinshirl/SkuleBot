Question 1 [2 Marks]
Given a char type variable named c that has already been declared and initialized to a value,
write a relational expression that evaluates to TRUE if and only if c is an upper or lower case
letter of the English alphabet.

Question 2 [2 Marks]

Correct the errors in the following complete C program to produce the intended output shown
below.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{

for (; i <= 4; i+);
{

printf("****");

}
return 0;

}

Intended output:

****
****
****
****

Question 3 [2 Marks]
A line in two-dimensional x, y Cartesian space can be expressed as y = mx+b, where m is the slope
of the line and b is the intercept of the line with the y-axis. Given that m and b (representing the
slope and intercept) are double type variables that have already been declared and initialized,
and given that y1 is a double type variable that has already been declared and initialized to
represent a position on the y-axis. Write a single C statement that declares and initializes a double
type variable x1, such that x1,y1 represents a point on the line. You may assume that m is non-
zero.

Question 4 [2 Marks]
Suppose that i is an int variable with value 3, and j is an int variable with value −2. Please
evaluate the following expression (to true or false).

Answer

Expression
(i != j)

(j)

((i > 3) && (j < 0))

((i > 3) ||(j < 0))

Question 5 [2 Marks]

Consider the following C statements:

int i = 2;
int j = 2;
int *p = &i;
int *q = &j;
i++;
j--;
*p = *q + 2;
*q = *p + 3;
p=q;
*p = *q + 1;

Enter the values of the variables i and j after the execution of the statements in the following
table:

Variable

What does the following program print?

#include <stdio.h>
int main (void) {

int n = 1;

do {

}

printf("*%d",n);
if (n % 3 == 0) printf("\n");

Question 7 [2.5 Marks]

Write what the following program will print.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){

int i=5, j=0, k=3;

i *= j;
i *= k;

k++;

printf("%d-%d-%d", i, j, k);

return 0;

}

Question 8 [2.5 Marks]

What does the following program print?

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){

int num=0;
char letter= ’a’;

for (;num<=4;){

letter++;
printf("%d*%c\n", num++,letter);
}

return 0;
}

Question 9 [2.5 Marks]

Determine the values of the variables W, X, Y and Z after the function SumEm executes in the main
program of the following C program:

#include <stdio.h>

void SumEm (int *A, int B, int C, int *D) {

if (B > C) {

*A = B + *D;
*D = C;

}
else {

*A = C + *D;
*D = B;

}

return;

}

int main (void) {

int W, X, Y, Z;

W = 0;
X = 5;
Y = 8;
Z = 10;

SumEm(&W,X,Y,&Z);

return 0;

}

Answer:

W =

X =

Y =

Z =

Question 10 [6 Marks]
Write a complete C program to rotate the values of three integer variables: a, b and c. Their initial
values are 1, 2 and 3, respectively. This program must make use of a function called rotateVar,
which you are to write as well, and will be the function called to effect the rotation of values. All
variables should be local variables. The output should print:

• b taking the initial value of c

• c taking the initial value of a

• a taking the initial value of b

Question 11 [6 Marks]

Write a C program that calculates the sum of all of the numbers from 1 to 1000 that obey ALL of
the following conditions:

(a) The number is divisable by three.

(b) The number is odd.

(c) The ten’s digit of the number is NOT 5. (e.g. the ten’s digit in 753 is 5, and the ten’s digit of

681 is 8; the ten’s digit of the number 9 is 0)

Answer:

10

Question 12 [6 Marks]
Write a complete C program that prompts the user for an int type variable n and then computes
and prints a value from the individual digits of n in the following manner: The least-signiﬁcant
digit d contributes d to the value. The next digit e contributes e2 to the value. The next digit
f contributes f 3 to the value, and so on. For example, if the integer entered is 156, the value
computed is: 6 + 52 + 13 = 32. Below is a sample execution of the program. Your output should
conform to this format.

Enter an integer: 2145
The computed value is: 38

Question 13 [6 Marks]

Write a program to print the days of the month in a calendar format. The program is to take as
inputs a number corresponding to the month, and a number corresponding to the weekday in
which the ﬁrst day falls. The days must be displayed in rows from Sunday to Saturday. If the ﬁrst
day of the chosen month does not fall on a Sunday, blanks should be used for the days preceding
the ﬁrst day. You are to indicate with comments within the program the number of blanks you are
printing in order to align your output properly. There is no need to print the names of the week
days, or to test for leap years.
Months with 31 days: January, March, May, July, August, October, December.
Months with 30 days: April, June, September, November.
Month with 28 days: February.

Below is a sample of the input and output of the program.

Enter the number corresponding to the month (1=Jan, 12=Dec): 10
Enter the starting day of the week (1=Sun, 7=Sat): 3

Question 14 [6 Marks]

You are to write a C language function called Combo that takes in three parameters: The ﬁrst two
parameters are character variables C1 and C2, and the third is an integer, N.

The characters C1 and C2 are guaranteed to be capitals only, and that C1 comes before C2 in the
alphabet.

Your function must print exactly N three letter ’words’ that only use the range of letters from C1
to C2 in all three positions.

In addition, none of the letters that are printed in any given word can be the same.

If N is larger than the number of possible such words, then the program should simply print all
possible words.

One word should be printed per line.

Note that there may be different ways to select the letters in the words that meet the speciﬁcations
given above; any allowable three letters are ok, as long as they meet the speciﬁcations.
