1.   The shear leg derrick is used to haul the 300-kg net of fish 

onto the dock. Determine the force along each of the legs AB 
and CB and the tension in the winch cable DB. Assume 
Members AB and CB are two force members.

2.   Cables OA, OB and OC are used to support a crate as 

shown. If the allowable tensile strength of each cable is 
1200 N, determine the largest mass of the crate that can be 
supported. Note that the cable supporting the mass has a 
higher strength and therefore will not rupture.

3.  Pole OA is subjected to the force shown.  

Find  the  magnitude  and  Cartesian  vector  expression  of  the 
projected components of the force:  
i.)  parallel to the pole, and  
ii.)  perpendicular to the pole. 

iii.)  Find the angle θ. 

4.  A bent pipe is subjected to the forces as shown. Determine: 

i.)   the resultant moment of the force about point O as a 

Cartesian vector, and 

ii.)  the magnitude of the moment.
