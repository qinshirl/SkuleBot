Multiple Choice Solutions

1. The inequality −2 ≤ x ≤ 8 can be expressed in the form |x + a| ≤ b, where a =

and

b =

. [1 mark]

Solution:|x−(−a)| ≤ b, is an interval centered at −a of radius b. Since the interval −2 ≤ x ≤ 8
is centered at x = 3, with radius 5 we have a = −3 and b = 5.

]. [2 marks]

Solution: f (x) = x2 − 1 is an upward opening parabola with vertex at (x, f (x)) = (0, −1) and
roots at ±1, therefore, f (x) is strictly negative on the interval [−
], therefore the maximum
of |f (x)| on this interval is 1. This implies the provided numbers which are upper bounds are

3. One of your professors (we’re not naming names) has noticed that student’s raw scores on a
linear algebra test is a decreasing function of time they spend on their phones. This same
professor noticed that, given a raw score, they could determine how much time a student spent
on their phone. Which of the functions below could represent this professor’s observations? [1
mark]

Solution: We look for a function that is decreasing (and invertible).

• f (t) = 100 sin(t + 50) + 100 oscillates, and therefore is not decreasing (nor invertible).

• g(t) = 100 −

, is increasing for 0 ≤ t ≤ 50, and therefore does not correspond to

(t − 50)2

the professor’s observations.

• h(t) = 100 e −t2

50 , this is the ONLY option which could represent the professor’s observa-

tions.

• k(t) = 100 − 2−t, is invertible but increasing.

4. Recall that sin−1(x) is the inverse of sin(x) whose domain is restricted to [− π

2 ], and cos−1(x)
is the inverse of cos(x) whose domain is restricted to [0, π]. We define a new inverse function
as follows:

2 , π

zin−1(x) is defined to be the inverse of sin(x) whose domain is restricted to [ π

2 ].

Fill in the blank: A solution to the equation cos(zin−1(x)) = sin(cos−1(x)) does not exist when

. [2 marks]

2 ], which implies that cos(zin−1(x)) ≤ 0. In contrast,
Solution: The range of zin−1(x) is [ π
the range of cos−1(x) is [0, π], which implies that sin(cos−1(x)) ≥ 0. Therefore, equality of
these two functions can only occur when cos(zin−1(x)) = sin(cos−1(x)) = 0, which occurs when
x = ±1.

2 , 3π

Thus a solution does not exist when x ∈ (−1, 0) or x ∈ (0, 1).

5. Let a and b be positive constants, where a ̸= b. The graph of a function f (x) is pictured below,
together with the vertical line x = −a, and the vertical line x = b. Which of the expressions
below could represent the function f (x)? [1 mark]

Solution:

. This would have both vertical asymptotes at positive x values, so

• f (x) =

• f (x) =

x
(x − a)(x − b)
this is not the correct choice.
x
(x + a)(x − b)
−x
(x + a)(x − b)
−x
(x − a)(x − b)
this is not the correct choice.

• f (x) =

• f (x) =

. For x > b this function is positive, so it does not match the graph.

. This is our function!

. This would have both vertical asymptotes at positive x values, so

7. Suppose that f (x) and g(x) are differentiable functions defined for all x, and satisfy the following

properties:

• f (−2) = g(−2)
• f ′(x) < g′(x) for all x.

Which of the statements below are true? [2 marks]

• f (x) < g(x) for all x > −2. This is true since g(x) is growing faster than f (x) everywhere

on this interval and g(−2) = f (−2), so f (x) can never catch back up.

• f (x) < g(x) for all x < −2. This is false, in fact, f (x) > g(x) for all x < −2.
• The graphs of f and g do not intersect. They intersect at x = −2.
• The graphs of f and g intersect at exactly one point. This is true since f (x) > g(x) for

x < −2 and g(x) > f (x) for x > −2.

• The graphs of f and g intersect at more than one point. No.

8. Let f (x) be differentiable for all x, and let g(x) be the tangent line to f at a point a ̸= 0.

Which of the expression(s) below are equal to f ′(a)? [2 marks]

• g′(a). g(x) has a constant slope of f ′(a), therefore g′(a) = f ′(a), so this is true.
• g(a + 1) − g(a). g(a + 1) − g(a) = g(a+1)−g(a)

, so it is the slope of a secant line of g(x),

which is always equal to g′(a) = f ′(a), so this is true.

. This yields f ′(0), so in general this is false.

• lim
h→0

f (0 + h) − f (0)

• f (x) − f (a)

will not equal f ′(a), so this is false.

This is the slope of a secant line with an endpoint at x = a. In general this

. Then there exists a c ∈ [−

, 3] such that f (c) = 0.

5
2

Solution: f (1) = 2 − 10 = −8 < 0 and f (3) = 8 − (3 + 1
3) > 0. Since f (x) is the difference
of a power function and a rational function, it is continuous on its domain, which contains
the interval (0, ∞). Therefore, since f (x) is negative at x = 1 and positive at x = 3, the
Intermediate Value Theorem states that there must exist a point c ∈ (1, 3) such that f (c) = 0.
Therefore the statement is true.

Short Answer Solutions

10. Let f (x) represent the fuel efficiency, in kilometres per liters, of a car travelling at a speed of

x kilometres per hour.

(b) Suppose f ′(101) = 0.74. If you are driving at 101 kilometres per hour, should you speed
up or slow down to be more fuel efficient? Briefly explain. Enter either “speed up" or
“slow down" in the box provided as your final answer.

Solution: You should speed up, since f ′(101) = 0.74 > 0, means the graph is increasing
at this point and therefore the car has an increased fuel efficiency when moving (at least
slightly) faster than 101 km

where A and B are positive constants.

x ≥ 2

(a) Find all values of A ad B such that f (x) is continuous at x = 1 and x = 2.

Solution: To have continuity at x = 1, we require lim
x→1−
For x ≤ 1, we have f (x) = 52x−2 + 2, which is a constant plus the composition of an exponential
function and a polynomial, therefore it is continuous on its domain.
Therefore,

f (x) = lim
x→1+

f (x) = f (1).

f (x) = f (1) = 3. We now need to ensure lim
x→1+

f (x) = 3 as well. In the interval
