MIE100S – Winter 2017 
Tutorial Problem 12a 

A 5-kg block is suspended from a spring having a stiffness of 300 N/m. If the block is acted upon by a vertical 
periodic force 𝐹 = (7 sin 8𝑡)𝑁 where t is in seconds, determine the equation which describes the motion of the 
block when it is pulled down 100 mm from the equilibrium position and released from rest at 𝑡 = 0. Consider 
positive displacement to be downward.

Tutorial Problem 12b 

The small block at A has a mass of 4 kg and is mounted on the bent rod having negligible mass. If 
the rotor at B causes a harmonic movement 𝛿𝐵 = (0.1 cos 15𝑡) 𝑚, where t is in seconds, determine 
the steady-state amplitude of vibration of the block.
