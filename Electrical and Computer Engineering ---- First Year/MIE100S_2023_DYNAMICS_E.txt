Question 2a
The wheel of radius R = 
0.21 meters rolls without 
slipping. The bar AB of 
length 0.85 meters is pinned 
to the edge of the wheel at 
point “B”. Point “A” of the 
bar drags horizontally along 
the ground.

Use the coordinate system 
specified in the diagram; the 
line OB makes an angle 0 
with respect to the x-axis, as 
shown. Watch your plus/minus signs!

_____

The centre of the wheel is at the origin of the coordinate system.

Suppose 0 = J; co = —2 — k;a = +3.5 fc.

What is the distance to the instantaneous center of zero velocity of bar AB from point A at this instant?

Question 3a

disk A

VySA'

e = 25°

A circular disk of mass = 
16 kg and radius, R - 0.45m, is 
rolling without slip on an incline 
with a slope of d = 25°. A rope is 
attached to the centre of the disk 
and is wound around a pulley 
system. At this instant, the disk has 
an angular acceleration a and 
angular velocity to. Block B hangs 
vertically from the large pulley.

The rope and pulleys all have 
negligible mass.

Given a = 7.42 — clockyvise^ find the tension in the rope. (6 marks)
