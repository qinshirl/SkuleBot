1.  Simply-supported  beam  AB  is  subjected  to  a  uniformly-distributed  load  and  a  point  load  as 
shown in Fig. (a). The cross section of the beam and the stress distribution due to the internal 
bending moment at C are shown in Fig. (b). The beam is constructed from the structural steel 
with a yield strength of 400 MPa. Determine: 

i.)   the location of the centroid of the cross section with reference to line DE, 
ii.)  the total compression force acting on the cross section, 
iii.) the maximum tensile stress, σt, (and comment on the adequacy of the cross section) 
iv.) the magnitude of the internal bending moment at point C, 
v.)  the magnitude of the force acting on DEFG, and (indicate whether tension or compression) 
vi.) the value of the uniformly distributed load, q.

2.  Beam AB, supported by a roller at A and a pin at B, is subjected to a uniformly distributed load,
a point load and a couple moment as shown in Fig (a). At point C, the internal stress distribution
due to bending of the beam, which has an opening at mid-height, is shown in Fig. (b). Compute: 

i.)   the magnitude of the stress σc in MPa, 
ii.)  the internal bending moment acting on the beam at C in kNm, and 
iii.) the magnitude of the point load P in kN.

3.  Plate ABCD is supported by a ball-and-socket at A, a 
cable at B and a special pin at D which only restrains 
the movements along x- and z-directions. The plate
