2014 – Midterm Vocabulary List and information 

Information: The following instructions will appear on the first page of the midterm test. 

This is a 70-minute midterm exam. There are 36 questions on the test. It is a multiple-choice midterm and is 
closed book. No aids are permitted. Read each question thoroughly and provide the answer on the answer 
sheet. Be sure to fill out the answer sheet clearly with no overlaps. Fill out the answer sheet using a pencil. 
Erase any errors completely. One answer per question and each question is worth 1 mark. There is no 
deduction for wrong answers. Select the answer that best satisfies the question. You are not required to hand 
in the exam question booklet. You may tear off the appendix to ease the answering of questions. 

Case study: The case study will appear in an appendix to the test. The case study deals with a label adhering 
problem. We are assuming you have read and understood everything in the case study. If you have 
questions about the case study, please ask on Piazza before the exam. No questions about the case study 
will be answered during the exam. We do not expect you to have formulated a solution for this problem. 

Vocabulary: We will assume that you know (and can answer questions about) the terms that appear in the 

textbook, case study and readings, or that have appeared in lecture.  

The following is a list of some additional words you may find on the Midterm. It does not include all of the 
words on the exam, and some of these words will not appear on the exam. Words that have been 
specifically defined or discussed in lecture or readings are not listed. Familiarity with these words will help 
you move more quickly through the exam. You should also be familiar with their plural form, past tense 
form, etc. If you already have a good understanding of the common meaning of these words, then there is 
no need to look them up in a dictionary, or spend any additional time studying them.
