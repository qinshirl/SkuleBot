1. The suspension for the landing gear of an airplane is shown. The wheel is attached to rod BC, which can 
slide vertically without friction in housing A that is fixed to the fuselage of the aircraft. The spring is pre-
compressed so that it does not undergo additional shortening until the force supported by the landing gear, 
F, is sufficiently large. Furthermore, if the force F exceeds a limit value, the suspension ‘bottoms out’ and 
cannot deflect further. Determine the spring constant, k, and the unstretched length of the spring, l, if: 

o  h = 60 cm, for F ≤ 5,000 N; and 
o  h = 40 cm, for F ≥ 15,000 N. 

= 60 cm 

= 40 cm 

= 5 kN 

= 15 kN

2. The assembly shown is used to control the tension T in a tape that passes around a frictionless pulley at 
E. Rods ABC and CDE are rigidly connected through welding to collar C. AB is parallel to the z-axis, BC 
and DE are parallel to the y-axis, and CD is parallel to the x-axis. The collar can rotate only about shaft FG 
and its motion along the shaft is prevented by a washer, S. F and G are fixed supports for the shaft. Given 
the loading and configuration shown, determine:  
(a) The tension T in the tape; and  
(b) The Cartesian expression for the reaction force at C and its magnitude.

3. For the truss loaded as illustrated, determine the force in members BC, CJ, DF, FH, HI and state if the 
members are in tension or compression. Also, indicate zero-force members, if there are any.
