SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS 

We are not looking for long paragraph answers.  
Short bullet–point answers are fine. Use the spaces 
provided on the question paper to write your  
answers. 

Questions 19 & 20 refer to the following statement: 

You work for a food company that will make a new energy bar with ground cashew nuts.  
The nuts need to be ground into smaller pieces, and for the purposes of this quiz, we will 
assume that no one has ever designed equipment to do this.  

19.  (3 MARKS)  List TWO suitable objectives and ONE suitable constraint for the 

design.  

OBJECTIVES:   

CONSTRAINT:  

20. (2 MARKS) When designing the grinder, your boss has asked you to draw on 

analogies to provide ideas.  Name two separate TYPES of analogy, and give an 
example of each relevant to the current problem.

21. (3 MARKS) You have just invented a new process for making waxed cardboard, 
which is the perfect material for making pizza boxes. You are sure that you can 
capture 40% of the “pizza box market” with your new cardboard, and you want to test 
this idea in one town: Hamilton Ontario, which has a population of about 500,000.   
You want to make enough cardboard to supply Hamilton for six months, before you 
invest in a full sized factory to supply all of North America.    

In the space below, estimate how many square metres of the new cardboard you 
should produce for your test. You must compute an actual number, and the steps 
used in making your estimate.  MAKE SURE YOU INDICATE THE UNITS OF ALL 
QUANTITIES INVOLVED IN THE CALCULATION.
