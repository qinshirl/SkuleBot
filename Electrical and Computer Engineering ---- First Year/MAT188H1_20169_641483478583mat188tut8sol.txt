Which of the following statements about A are guaranteed to be true, where Ai denotes the ith column
of A.

You may want to consult the paragraph ”Basis of the Column Space of a Matrix” on page 158 of the
textbook before attempting this question.

(a) The columns of A are linearly independent.

(b) The system of equations Ax = b has a solution for every b ∈ R4.

(c) The system of equations Ax = b has at most one solution for every b ∈ R4.

(d) A4 is a linear combination of A1, A2, and A5.

(e) A3 is a linear combination of A1, A2, and A5.

(f ) A3 is a linear combination of A1 and A2.

(g) A4 = A1 − 2A2.

Solution:

(a) False, the columns of A are in R4 and there are 6 of them so they cannot be linearly independent.

(b) False, from R we see that A has rank 3 and so dim col(A) = 3. But Ax = b has a solution if and only

if b ∈ col(A).

(c) False, because dim null(A) = 3 so there are inﬁnitely many solutions to Ax = 0.

(d) True, from R we see that A1, A2 and A5 form a basis for col(A).

(e) True, from R we see that A1, A2 and A5 form a basis for col(A).

(f ) True, otherwise R would have a leading entry in its third column.

(g) False. We could have R = A in which case this obviously fails.

Let’s analyze each row separately. But before we do that, let’s make a few preliminary observations.

First, rank(A) = dim(col(A)). So the 4th and 5th columns will always have the same values. Next,
we shall be making constant use of the rank-nullity theorem (Theorem 8, page 161 of the textbook), which
states that if A is an m × n matrix, then

n = rank(A) + nullity(A).

This allows us to determine the rank of A if we have its nullity and vice versa.
Consider Ax = b (here we retain that A is m × n so x ∈ Rn and b ∈ Rm). Theorem 3, page 155 of he
textbook tells us that this system will be consistent if and only if b is in the column space of A. Hence
the system will be consistent for every b ∈ Rm if and only if col(A) = Rm, or equivalently, if and only if
rank(A) = m. The system has at most one solution if and only if the columns of A are linearly independent.

The columns of A are linearly independent if and only if they form a basis for the column space of A. Because
A has n columns, this last statement is equivalent to having rank(A) = n (or, by the rank-nullity theorem,
to having nullity(A) = n − n = 0). To summarize: We can put ”yes” under ”Ax = b consistent ∀ b”
if and only if rank(A) = m. We can put ”yes” under ”Ax = b has at most one solution” if and
only if rank(A) = n.

• Row 1: If Ax = b is consistent for every b ∈ R3, then rank(A) = 3 and so dim(col(A)) = 3 too. The
rank-nullity theorem tells us that nullity(A) = 4 − 3 = 1. In particular, nullity(A) (cid:54)= 0, so A doesn’t
give unique solutions.

• Row 2: The rank-nullity theorem tells us that rank(A) = 5 − 1 = 4, so dim(col(A)) = 4 too. As
rank(A) (cid:54)= 5, we conclude that the system Ax = b cannot be consistent for every b. For the same
reason, the system will not have a unique solution when it is consistent.

• Row 3: We immediately get that rank(A) = 5 and so nullity(A) = 5 − 5 = 0 by the rank-nullity
theorem. Next, because rankA = 5 and A is 5 × 5 the system Ax = b must be consistent and admit a
unique solution for all b ∈ R5.

• Row 4: We must have that nullity(A) = 0 and so rank(A) = 2 − 0 = 2. Then dim(col(A)) = 2,
too. Since rank(A) (cid:54)= 3, the system Ax = b cannot be consistent for all b ∈ R3. On the other hand,
because rank(A) = 2, the system will have a unique solution whenever it is consistent.

• Row 5: We conclude immediately that rank(A) = 4 and so dim(col(A)) = 4 and so we get unique

solutions in this case. And of course nullity(A) = 4 − 4 = 0.

• Row 6: The rank of A is not equal to either the number of rows or columns, so we don’t get consistency

or uniqueness for all systems here. And nullity(A) = 4 − 3 = 1 by the rank-nullity theorem.

Finally, let’s determine which of these rows describe invertible matrices. First oﬀ, for a matrix to be invertible,
it has to be square. So we need only consider the matrices described by rows 2, 3 and 5. Next, recall that
an n × n is invertible if and only if its rank is n (or equivalently, if and only if its nullity is 0). From our
table above, we see that rows 3 and 5 satisfy this condition, but row 2 does not. Thus only rows 3 and 5
describe invertible matrices.

(d) Find two diﬀerent bases for row(A). Justify your answers.

(e) True or False: null(A) is equal to the set of solutions to the system

x1 + x2 + 3x3 + 2x4 = 0
17x1 − 24x2 − 31x3 + 34x4 = 0

Solution:

(a) Let A1, A2, A3 and A4 denote the columns of 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th columns of A, respectively. Then
by inspection we see that A4 = 2A1 and A3 = A1 + 2A2. Moreover, A1 and A2 are not multiples of
each other. So we see that, among the columns of A, the ﬁrst two are independent and span the other
two. Thus {A1, A2} is a basis for the column space of A, and therefore rank(A) = dim col(A) = 2.

(b) Since A is 10 × 4, the rank-nullity theorem tells us that so nullity(A) = 4 − rank(A) = 2.

(c) No, because rank(A) (cid:54)= 10.

(d) We know that dim row(A) = rank(A) = 2, so any two linearly independent rows of A will form a basis.

For instance, we may take the ﬁrst and third rows, or the ﬁrst and fourth, or ...

(e) True. The ﬁrst and ninth rows of A are linearly independent (because they are not multiples of each
other), and hence form a basis for row(A). This means, in particular, that all the other rows of A are
linear combinations of these two. Thus we can perform row operations to A to transform it into

Then null(A) is equal to null(R) (because row operations do not alter the null-space). But null(R) is,
by deﬁnition, equal to

the set of all x ∈ R4 such that Rx = 0,

or equivalently,

the set of all

This is precisely the set of solutions to the system

−7x1 + 4x2 + x3 − 14x4 = 0.
