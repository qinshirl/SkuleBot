CIV100F/APS160F	–	Mechanics:	Final	Exam	2014	

Question 1 
Draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams in the space reserved below for the beam ABCD 
shown, indicating the values at points A, B, C and D, as well as any potential local maxima or minima. The 
beam is fixed at A, has an internal pin at B and is supported by a vertical pin-ended hanger at point C. 
The only material available to construct this beam is flat steel plate with a thickness of 100 mm, which 
can be cut in strips of various widths, in multiples of 10 mm. Determine the cross-sectional dimensions 
of the beam having the least weight and express your final answer in terms of the ‘Width x Height’ (i.e. 
‘Horizontal x Vertical’ dimensions) of the cross-section. The yield stress for the steel available is 300 MPa 
and the load factor for bending is 1.9. 

Answer: 

The required beam size is 
W x H = 100.0 x 200 mm 

Question 2 

Question 4 

Question 5 

Determine the reaction components 
at A and D for this pin-connected 
frame. The cable passes behind the 
frame without touching it and the 
frictionless pulley is pinned to member 
CF at G. 

Answers: 

Ax = 25.8 kN 
Ay = 20.0 kN 
Dx = 8.50 kN 
Dy = 10.00 kN 

Question 3 
The truss shown is supported by a pin at P and a diagonal cable AB, at B. Determine the force in 
members BM, MN, CM and CD, and indicate whether they are in tension or compression. 
Members CD and BM are to be constructed from the same-size rectangular box cross section 
(shown), which is fabricated from 10 mm thick welded steel plate that can be cut in 5 mm 
increments. Knowing that the yield stress for steel is 350 MPa, the load factor for axially loaded 
bars is 2.25 and the modulus of elasticity for steel is 200,000 MPa, determine dimension d for the 
required section. Also, what is the elongation of member BM? 

5 

Answers: 

FBM = 70.7 kN (T) 
FMN = 150.0 kN (C) 
FCM = 10.00 kN (C) 
FCD = 100.0 kN (T) 

d = 50.0 mm 
DBM = +1.538 mm 

A long, continuous steel gate, BC, restrains 
fresh water as shown and is supported by 
hinges at A, which are spaced at 8 metre 
equal intervals in the longitudinal direction 
of the gate, and a continuous stop at B. 
Determine the reaction components for a 
typical hinge at A, and at B. 

Answers: 

Ax = 455 kN 
Ay = 245 kN 
Bx = 150.4 kN/m 

The turnbuckle on cable AD is tightened until the 
magnitude of the y-component of the ball-and-
socket reaction at O is 2,700 N. Determine the 
resulting force in cable AD. The mass of bar OAC is 
small and can be neglected. 

  Answer: 

TAD = 1,391 N (Tension)
