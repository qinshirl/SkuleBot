3. Graph the function f(x) = —2x  - 3 + 

Ix1I 

Organize your solution well. 
Include all of the important values, including any easy-to-find roots 
and identify their type (maximum, minimum, etc.). 
Indicate regions where the function is increasing vs. decreasing, concave 
up vs. concave down. 
You have two pages for this problem.
