MAT188H1F LINEAR ALGEBRA: Course Information as of

November 4, 2013

Section Instructors: By now you should be scheduled into one of the following Sections:

LEC0101 Cohen, S. LEC0102 Cho, S.
LEC0105 Bell, J.

LEC0106 Burbulla, D. LEC0107 Hay, D.

LEC0108 Santiago, L.

LEC0103 Huang, J. J. LEC0104 Pugh, M.

Textbook: Elementary Linear Algebra with Applications by Jeﬀrey Holt. Any version of this book,
be it hard cover or binder-ready soft cover, will do. Warning: this is the ﬁrst time we are
using Holt’s book. Its order of topics is totally diﬀerent than the book we were using previously.
Keep this in mind when you look at old quizzes and term tests. Moreover, Holt includes much
more material on linear transformations than our previous book, but less material on vectors in
three dimensions than our previous book. Anything you know from high school—such as the
dot product, the cross product, equations of lines and planes in three dimensions—can be used
in this course, if it helps you.

Tutorials: By now you should be scheduled into one tutorial. You should attend tutorials on a
regular basis; it is one place you can get help with your homework, and it is the only place
you can pick up your graded term tests and see the solutions taken up. There will also be
some tutorials devoted to general advice and supplementary topics, such as proof by induction
and complex numbers, which you may or may not have seen in high school. Tutorials start on
Monday, Sep 9th and end on Monday, Dec 2nd. There will be no tutorials on Monday, Oct 14th.

Marking Scheme: Diagnostic test: 5%; WeBWorK: 5%; Quiz: 10%; Test: 30%; Final Exam: 50%

WeBWorK: Information regarding this on-line homework website will be posted on the course web-
site in the second week of classes. WeBWorK homework will not begin until September 23.

Homework: Consider all the odd numbered exercises from the textbook, which have answers in the

back of the book, as your homework. You can get help from your TA in tutorials.

Quiz: A 50-min quiz will be written in your tutorial during the week of Sep 30-Oct 4.

Test: a 100-min term test is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct 29, 12:15-1:55 PM, locations TBA.

Final Exam: There will be a common ﬁnal exam, 150 min long, during the exam period, Dec 9-20.

Math Aid Oﬃce: GB 149. Hours: MTWRF 12:10-2 PM.

Classroom Deportment: the format of lectures is more formal than what you may be used to.
This means that during lectures there should not be any disruptions that would prevent other
students from hearing or seeing the instructor. That is: no talking, no cell phones, no music, no
eating or drinking. You should raise your hand to ask a question. You should arrive on time. If
you do arrive late, please enter by a back door and sit down in the ﬁrst available seat so as not
to disrupt the rest of the class.

Calculators: Use of a Casio FX-991MS or Sharp EL-520X calculator will be permitted during all
quizzes, tests and exams. However, it is still your responsibility to explain your work. A correct
answer with no justiﬁcation will receive no marks.

Course Outline, Lecture Schedule and Tutorial Schedule: The following schedule of 38 lectures
is only approximate. Sections marked with an asterisk (*) are optional and may not be covered in
lectures, but you may ﬁnd them interesting to read! Optional sections will not be tested or examined.

We will not cover numerical methods, Sections 1.3 and 6.2. Some tutorial time will be spent on complex
numbers, reference Section 6.5, because they no longer seem to be covered in high school. Your lecturer
may or may not include complex eigenvalues in Sections 6.5 and 6.6. Either way, quizzes, tests and
exams in MAT188H1F will not require complex numbers. In Section 8.3 we’ll skip QR Factorization.
We won’t do anything from Chapters 7, 9, 10 or 11.
Tutorial Schedule: Tn represents the n-th tutorial, 1 ≤ n ≤ 12.

T1: proof/induction
T5: linear maps of R2 T6: invertibility
T9: test returned
