Q2 [10 marks] A parallel plate capacitor is formed by two identical metal plates, each with an area A = 12 
cm2. The plates are separated by a distance d = 3.25 mm. The top plate has a charge of q = 4.3 x 10-8 C while 
the bottom plate has a charge of q = -4.3 x 10-8 C. 

i) What is the capacitance of the capacitor? (1 mark)
