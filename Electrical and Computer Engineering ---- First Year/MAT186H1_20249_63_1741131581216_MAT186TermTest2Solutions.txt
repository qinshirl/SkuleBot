5. It is generally understood that, given a sound source (e.g. a stereo speaker), each time we double of the number of
speakers, the sound intensity increases by 3 decibels (dB).

Let f (x) be the number of speakers, and let x be the sound intensity (in dB). Which of the following statements is the
best interpretation of (f −1)′(15) = 0.2? [1 mark]

Indicate your final answer by filling in exactly one circle below (unfilled

filled ).

⃝ If we have 15 speakers, then adding another speaker will increase the sound intensity by 0.2 dB.

⃝ The sound intensity with 15 speakers is approximately 0.2 times the sound intensity with 16 speakers.

⃝ With 15 speakers, the rate at which the sound intensity is increasing is 0.2 speakers per dB.

The sound intensity with 13 speakers is approximately 0.4 dB less than the sound intensity with 15 speakers.

⃝ If we increase the number of speakers from 15 to 16, then the sound intensity would be approximately 0.2 dB

greater than the sound intensity with one speaker.

The first option is incorrect as the sound intensity will increase by approximately 0.2 dB, not exactly 0.2 dB as stated.
The second option expresses the derivative as a multiplicative factor which is incorrect, as well as reversing the roles of
15 and 16 speakers in our interpretation. The third option assigns incorrect units to the derivative of the inverse (should
be dB/speaker). The final option incorrectly references the relationship between (f −1)′(15), (f −1)′(16) and the sound
intensity with one speaker. Therefore, the correct choice is the fourth statement. This statement correctly expresses the
approximate linear relationship between the loudness at 15 speakers, and a nearby point (13 speakers).

6. Suppose that f (x) is differentiable everywhere, and that f ′(x) > 0 for all x. Which of the statements below are true?
[2 marks]

You can fill in more than one option for this question (unfilled

filled ).

⃝ (f −1)′(x) =

1
f (x)

.

(f −1)′(x) =

1
f ′(f −1(x))

.

(f −1)′(x) > 0.

(f −1)′(f (x)) > 0.

If f ′(x) is increasing, then (f −1)′(f (x)) is decreasing.

We are given f (x) is differentiable and striclty increasing (invertible) over its whole domain. Therefore, f (f −1(x)) = x
for every x, and by chain rule

f ′(f −1(x))(f −1)′(x) = 1

which rearranges to the second option. The remaining three options follow from this expression.

10. Carefully sketch the graph of a function f (x) on the axes below that satisfies all the given properties. [2.5 marks]

• f (x) is continuous on (−4, 4).

• f ′(x) is negative and increasing on (−4, 0).

• f ′(x) is positive and decreasing on (0, 4).

To satisfy these conditions, for x < 0 we choose a function that is decreasing (f ′(x) is negative) and concave up (f ′(x) is
increasing). Conversely, for x > 0 we choose a function which is increasing (f ′(x) is positive) and concave down (f ′(x) is
decreasing). In addition, we require that the derivative of the function as it approaches x = 0 from the left is 0, while the
derivative from the right approaches ∞ (i.e., tends towards a vertical line). Finally, both sides of the function must meet
at the same y-value when x = 0 to maintain continuity.

(100 − L).

(a) Sketch the phase line for this differential equation and classify the equilibrium point(s) on your sketch. [2 marks]

Solving dL
L > 100, the equilibrium is a stable equilibrium.

dt = 0, we find a single equilibrium point at L(t) = 100. Since dL/dt > 0 for L < 100, and dL/dt < 0 for

(b) The given differential equation models the function L(t), the percentage of a particular task that has been learned
after t months. Assume that 20% had been learned at t = 0.

(i) On the axes below, carefully sketch the solution to this initial value problem, clearly illustrating the long-term
behaviour of the solution. Justify any intervals of concavity in your sketch in the blank space to the right of the
given axes. [2.5 marks]

When L(t) < 100, we see that d2L/dt2 < 0,
which implies that the solution is concave down.
Another approach would be to sketch the graph
of L′ vs. L and observe that L′ is positive and
decreasing.

(ii) Use Euler’s method with step size ∆t = 0.5 to estimate the percentage learned after one month. Show all your

work. [2.5 marks]

We have, ˜L(0.5) = L′(0)(0.5) + L(0) = 40, and ˜L(1) = ˜L′(0.5)(0.5) + ˜L(0.5) = 55. Therefore, the percentage learned
after one month is approximately 55%.

13. The curve given by the equation

defines y implicitly as a function of x.

y2 − 1 = 1 + x2(y − 1)

dx = 2x(y−1)
2y−x2 .

(b) Find the equation of the tangent line T (x) to the curve at (−

√

2, 0). [2 marks]

To find the equation of the tangent line, we consider a linear approximation to the relation at the point x = a, T (x) =
f ′(a)(x − a) + f (a). Substituting a = −

2 and y = f (a) = 0, and using our result for dy/dx above, we have:

We determine the points on the curve for which dy

dx = 0. Since

dy

dx = 0 when 2x(y − 1) = 0 and 2y − x2 ̸= 0. This occurs for x = 0, y ̸= 0 and y = 1, x ̸= ±

For y = 1,

14. A cylinder of radius r and height h is stored under a slanted roof as pictured below. The point (h, r) lies on the
straight line L given by the equation ay + bx = ab, where a and b are fixed positive numbers such that a + b = 1.

(a) Find an equation that represents h in terms of r and a. [2 marks]

Since (h, r) lies on the line ay + bx = ab, we have h = x = a − a

b y. Then, using that a + b = 1, we have
a
1 − a

r

h = a −

You can also determine this relation using similar triangles. (Note that a is a constant parameter, and r is a variable...this
matters in part (b)).

(b) Use the Closed Interval Method to determine the point (h, r) that maximizes the volume of the cylinder. Your answer
may include the letter a. [4 marks]

Hint: The volume of a cylinder of radius r and height h is V = πr2h.

Using part (a) we have,

where a is a constant parameter. .

V (r) = πr2(a −

a
1 − a

r)

From the Extreme Value Theorem, we know that V (r) must take on its maximum value on some closed interval at an
endpoint, or at some interior point of the interval. From our diagram, we see that the interval of interest for r is between
b = 1 − a (corresponding to a cylinder with 0 height), and 0, corresponding to a cylinder with 0 radius. Evaluating V at
both of these locations returns V = 0, thus we expect our maximum volume to occur at a critical point inside this interval.

Differentiating V (r) on (0, 1 − a), we find

Solving V ′(r) = 0, we obtain:

V ′(r) = π
