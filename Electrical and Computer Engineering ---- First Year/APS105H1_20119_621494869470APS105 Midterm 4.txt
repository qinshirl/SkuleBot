Question 1 [3 Marks]
Write a single C statement that declares a bool variable named myBool and sets its value to true
if and only if the value stored in an integer variable named myInt is an even positive number.
You may assume that the variable myInt has been declared and initialized already to some value.

Question 2 [3 Marks]

√

5−1
The golden ratio conjugate Φ is deﬁned as Φ =
. This mathematical constant is used in different
2
ﬁelds of computer engineering such as numerical analysis, combinatorial algorithms, etc. Write
a single C statement that declares a constant variable named PHI and sets PHI to be equal to the
value of Φ given above. You may make use of functions deﬁned in math.h.

Question 3 [3 Marks]

Suppose we have the following declaration and initialization of variables:

double a = 23.0, b = 20.0, c = 15.0, d = 8.0, e = 40.0;

What is the value for the following expression?

(int) (a + b / (c - 5.0)) / ((d + 7.0) / (e - 37.0) / 2.0)

Question 4 [4 Marks]
Let i be an int variable with value 5, j be an int variable with value 0, and k be a bool variable
set to false. State whether the following expressions evaluate to true or false.

Expression

Answer

( (i >= 3) && (j == (int) 0.0) )

( ((i != 3) || (j != 4)) == !((i == 3) && (j == 4)) )

!( (i-4) <= 0 )

( k && (sin(42.0) == 0.1372) )

Question 5 [4 Marks]

Question 7 [8 Marks]

int b = 2;

while (a <= 45)
{

printf("%d\n", a);
a += b;
b++;

}

return 0;

}

Question 8 [8 Marks]

{

int row, col;
for (row = 1; row <= 5; row++)
{

for (col = 1; col <= 9; col++)
{

if ((col > row) && (col <= (9-row)))

printf(" ");

else

printf("*");

}
printf("\n");

}

return 0;

}

What is the output from an execution of this C program?

Question 9 [4 Marks]
For each of the following parts, determine the number of times that the word Chicken will be
printed. Place your answer in the appropriate box.

(a)

for (int i=0; i < 10; i++)

for (int j=0; j < 10; j++)

if (i < j)

printf("Chicken\n");

Will print Chicken

times.

(b)

for (int i=0; i >= 0; i++)
for ( ; i < 100; )
while (i != 0)

printf("Chicken\n");

Will print Chicken

times.

Question 10 [12 Marks]

Write a program that prompts the user to enter two dates and then indicates which date comes
earlier in the calendar. Assume that the user enters valid dates.

Here is a sample output from an execution of the program:

Enter first date (day/month): 20/10<enter>
Enter second date (day/month): 22/9<enter>
22/9 is earlier than 20/10

Here is another sample output from an execution of the program:

Enter first date (day/month): 20/10<enter>
Enter second date (day/month): 20/10<enter>
The two dates are the same.

#include <stdio.h>
int main (void)
{

}

Question 11 [12 Marks]

Write a program that ﬁnds the largest positive number in a list of numbers entered by the user.
The program must prompt the user to enter numbers one by one. When the user enters 0 or a
negative number, the program must stop prompting the user for numbers and display the largest
positive number that was entered. Note that the length of the list of positive numbers could be
arbitrarily large. You may assume that at least one positive number will be input.

Here is a sample output from an execution of the program:

Enter a number: 60<enter>
Enter a number: 4.89<enter>
Enter a number: 100.62<enter>
Enter a number: 75.2295<enter>
Enter a number: 0<enter>
The largest positive number entered was: 100.620000

Notice that the numbers aren’t necessarily integers.

#include <stdio.h>
int main (void)
{

}

Question 12 [12 Marks]
Write a function named pythagoreanTriples that accepts a positive integer x as its parameter,
and prints one triple (x, y, z) such that:

(a) x2 + y2 = z2;

(b) y > 0 and y <= 100;

(c) y < z;

(d) x, y, z are all positive integers.

If no triple exists that satisﬁes all four conditions, then the function prints "No solution exists.".
Assume that the argument value for x is a positive integer.

For example, if we compile and run the pythagoreanTriples function with the following
main() program:

int main (void)
{

pythagoreanTriples(3);
pythagoreanTriples(12);
pythagoreanTriples(20);
pythagoreanTriples(49);
return 0;

}

the following will be printed:

(3, 4, 5)
(12, 5, 13)
(20, 15, 25)
No solution exists.

Place your solution to this question on the next page.

Question 13 [12 Marks]
In the indicated position in the program below, deﬁne a function called rotate that rotates the
values pointed to by the three pointer-to-integer parameters in such a way that after executing the
function, the ﬁrst has the original value of the third, the second has the original value of the ﬁrst,
and the third has the original value of the second.

Example 1:

Please input three integers: 3 4 5
After rotation, the list of integers is: 5 3 4

Example 2:

Please input three integers: 9 3 7
After rotation, the list of integers is: 7 9 3

Program:

#include <stdio.h>

// define rotate HERE:
void rotate (int *a, int *b, int *c)
{

}

int main (void)
{

int x,y,z;

printf("Please input three integers: ");
scanf("%d %d %d",&x,&y,&z);

rotate(&x,&y,&z);

printf("After rotation, the list of integers is: %d %d %d\n",x,y,z);

return 0;

}

Question 14 [12 Marks]

Amicable numbers are two different positive integers such that the sum of the proper exact divi-
sors of each is equal to the other number. A proper exact divisor is a positive integer exact divisor
of a number, other than the number itself. For example, the proper exact divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and
3.

220 and 284 are amicable numbers. The reason is as follows: the proper exact divisors of 220 are
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110, the sum of which is 284. The proper exact divisors of 284
are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142, the sum of which is 220.

Write a complete C function called areAmicable, the prototype of which is given below, that
accepts two numbers of type int as parameters, named m and n. The function must return the
Boolean type bool. The function should return true if m and n are amicable numbers, and should
return false otherwise. You may assume that the arguments passed to the function are indeed
positive integers.

bool areAmicable (int m, int n)
{

}
