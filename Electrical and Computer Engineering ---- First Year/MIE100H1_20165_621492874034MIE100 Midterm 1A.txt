Question 1 [30 marks total] 

A cyclist travels in a circle at a constant speed of 9 m/s. The radius of the circle is R = 2.8 m and the circle is 
centered at (5,0) as shown in Figure 1. 

a)  Find all points along the cyclist’s path where the unit vector in the normal direction is equal to the 

unit vector in the radial direction. [5 marks] 

b)  What will be the acceleration of the cyclist when he is at the top of the circle?  Express your answer 

using the rectangular co-ordinate system given. [5 marks] 

c)  What will be the acceleration of the cyclist when he is at the bottom of the circle?  Express your 

answer using a polar system centered at (0,0). [10 marks] 

d)  At t = 0, the cyclist starts to slow down at 1.3 m/s2. At what time will the absolute values of the 

tangential and normal accelerations be equal to each other? [10 marks]

Question 2 [30 marks total] 

A 5 kg block sits on a conical dish that is rotating at a constant rate of 10 rad/s about the vertical 
axis (Figure 2). The static coefficient of friction between the block and the dish is μs = 0.28. 

Determine r, the distance between the vertical axis and the block, at which the block is on the 
verge of sliding up the dish.

Question 3 [30 marks total] 

A block “B” of mass 25 kg is connected to a spring with stiffness constant k = 20 N/m. At the 
position shown in Figure 3, the spring is stretched by 4 meters. The block is on a slope of angle 
50° with μk = 0.15. 

a)  Suppose the block is released from the position shown. For what values of μs will the 

block not start to slide down the hill? [10 marks] 

b)  Suppose the block is initially sliding down the slope at 3 m/s at the position shown. What 

is the magnitude of its acceleration at the position shown? [10 marks] 

c)  Suppose the block is initially moving down the slope at 3 m/s at the position shown. 

What will be the block’s speed when it has traveled 1.5 meters? [10 marks]
