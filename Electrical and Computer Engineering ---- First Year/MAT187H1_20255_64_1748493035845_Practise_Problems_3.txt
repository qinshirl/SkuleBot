Practise Problem Set 3

MAT 187 - Summer 2025

These questions are meant for your own practice for quiz 3 and are not to be handed in. Some of these
questions, or problems similar to these, may appear on the quizzes or exams. Therefore, solutions to these
problems will not be posted but you may, of course, ask about these questions during office hours, or on Piazza.

Suggestions on how to complete these problems:

• Solution writing is a skill like any other, which must be practiced as you study. After you write
down your rough solutions, take the time to write a clear readable solution that blends sentences and
mathematical symbols. This will help you to retain, reinforce, and better understand the concepts.

• After you complete a practice problem, reflect on it. What course material did you use to solve the
problem? What was challenging about it? What were the main ideas, techniques, and strategies
that you used to solve the problems? What mistakes did you make at the first attempt and how can
you prevent these mistakes on a Term Test? What advice would you give to another student who is
struggling with this problem?

• Discussing course content with your classmates is encouraged and a mathematically healthy practice.
Work together, share ideas, explain concepts to each other, compare your solutions, and ask each other
questions. Teaching someone else will help you develop a deeper level of understanding. However, it’s
also important that reserve some time for self-study and self-assessment to help ensure you can solve
problems on your own without relying on others.

interpolation instead of quadratic interpolation.

11. Taylor polynomials tend to be accurate in a symmetric region about the point where they are centered.
That is, if Tn is an nth Taylor approximation of f centered at a, we would expect T to be accurate in
some region (a − ε, a + ε). Here ε would depend on n, a, and f .

For this question, you may use the following Desmos link to graph Taylor approximations:

https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jdv3z3trvu

However, be warned for Taylor polynomials above degree 9 or so, Desmos suffers from significant rounding
errors.

(a) For this part we will be approximating the function f (x) = 1/x. Let Tn be the nth Taylor approxi-

mation to f centered at a.

i. When a = 2, for which ε is T8 a good approximation to f on the interval (a − ε, a + ε)? (Hint:

you will need to use your judgement to decide what a “good” approximation is.)

ii. When a = 1, for which ε is T8 a good approximation to f on the interval (a − ε, a + ε)?
iii. When a = 1/2, for which ε is T8 a good approximation to f on the interval (a − ε, a + ε)?
iv. Why does ε keep getting smaller as a gets smaller?
v. Based on your conjecture, find a formula for an upper bound for ε based on a.

(b) Repeat the previous part using f (x) = sin x. Does the region of “good” approximation, (a − ε, a + ε),

change as a changes?

(c) For this part, we will use the function f (x) = 1

1+x2 .

Use the following Desmos link: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/opdydtzixw

i. When a = 4, for which ε is T20 a good approximation to f on the interval (a − ε, a + ε)?
ii. When a = 3, for which ε is T20 a good approximation to f on the interval (a − ε, a + ε)?
iii. When a = 2, for which ε is T20 a good approximation to f on the interval (a − ε, a + ε)?
iv. Find all (complex) vertical asymptotes of the function f .
v. Why did ε shrink in the previous parts?
vi. Based on your conjecture, find a formula for an upper bound for ε based on a. (Hint: this part

will involve doing some geometry in the complex plane.)

1. Use the Taylor Remainder Theorem to find an upper bound for the error at x = 1
2.
2. The geometric sum formula states (cid:80)k

α−1 . Use the geometric sum formula to find a
closed-form expression for Pn(x) (i.e., an expression that does not use summation notation or any
“. . . ”s).
Use your formula to find an exact expression for the error at x = 1
decreases as we increase n.

2 and describe how the error

n=0 αn = αk+1−1

3. Use Desmos to graph f and Pn for n = 1 to n = 50. Based on your visual evidence, does Pn give
a good approximation for f in (−∞, 1)? If not, what is the interval over which Pn is a reasonable
approximation of f ?

4. Taylor’s remainder theorem states that |f (x) − Pn(x)| = f n+1(c(x))xn+1

, where c(x) takes on a mys-
terious value that depends on x and is somewhere between x and a. Normally, we cannot compute
c(x), but in this example we can. Find the function c(x).
