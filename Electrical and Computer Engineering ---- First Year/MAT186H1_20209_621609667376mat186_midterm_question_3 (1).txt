Problem 3. (6 pts total) We encounter an Unobtainium-rich pool in a cave on the planet Pandora.

• A water-Unobtainium solution having a constant concentration of 4 kg/L ﬂows into the

pool at a constant rate of 0.3 L/h.

• It is known that the pool loses Unobtainium to radioactive decay at a rate of 6 percent by

mass per hour.

• The well-mixed water-Unobtainium solution in the pool ﬂows out of the pool at a rate of
0.3 L/h. The solution ﬂowing out has the same concentration of Unobtainium as that of
the well-mixed pool.

• Additionally, we will harvest Unobtainium directly from the pool, removing it at a constant

rate of r kg per hour.

• When we arrive there are 5 liters of solution in the pool and 5 kilograms of Unobtainium

dissolved in it.

(a) (3 pts) Write an initial value problem for U (t), the mass of Unobtainium in the pool t hours after

we arrive. Explain your answer using complete sentences.

For parts (b) and (c), assume that r = 0.4.

(b) (1 pt) How quickly would the the mass of Unobtainium in the pool be changing at the exact mo-

ment there are 5 kilograms of it in the pool?

(c) (2 pts) Without solving the differential equation exactly, explain what would happen to the mass
of Unobtainium in the pool over time as t → ∞. Use complete sentences as part of your answer.
