Practise Problem Set 4

MAT 187 - Summer 2025

These questions are meant for your own practice for quiz 4 and are not to be handed in.
Some of these questions, or problems similar to these, may appear on the quizzes or exams.
Therefore, solutions to these problems will not be posted but you may, of course, ask about
these questions during office hours, or on Piazza.

Suggestions on how to complete these problems:

• Solution writing is a skill like any other, which must be practiced as you study. After
you write down your rough solutions, take the time to write a clear readable solu-
tion that blends sentences and mathematical symbols. This will help you to retain,
reinforce, and better understand the concepts.

• After you complete a practice problem, reflect on it. What course material did you
use to solve the problem? What was challenging about it? What were the main ideas,
techniques, and strategies that you used to solve the problems? What mistakes did
you make at the first attempt and how can you prevent these mistakes on a Term Test?
What advice would you give to another student who is struggling with this problem?

• Discussing course content with your classmates is encouraged and a mathematically
healthy practice. Work together, share ideas, explain concepts to each other, compare
your solutions, and ask each other questions. Teaching someone else will help you
develop a deeper level of understanding. However, it’s also important that reserve
some time for self-study and self-assessment to help ensure you can solve problems on
your own without relying on others.

1. For each of the following sequences, determine whether the sequence converges or di-

verges. If it converges, find the limit. Show appropriate reasoning.

2. Analyze the following recursively defined sequences.

Hint: If the sequence converges, L = limn→∞ an = limn→∞ an+1. For recursively defined
sequences, we can often plug this into the recursive relation to solve for the limit.

cos(x), and sin(x) to derive and justify the identity: eiθ = cos(θ) + i sin(θ). This
result is known as Euler’s formula, and it plays a fundamental role in the study
of complex numbers, both in this course and in future mathematics courses.

implementation?

(i.e., low frequencies)?

system?
