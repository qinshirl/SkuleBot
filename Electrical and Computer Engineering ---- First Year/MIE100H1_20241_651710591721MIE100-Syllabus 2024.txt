Online access 

Online  access  to  WileyPlus  website.  The  website  is  used  for  weekly  assignments  (as  described  in  Online 
assignments).  

Course Objectives 
General: 

•  Develop a working knowledge of the basic principles of classical mechanics. 

•  Acquire familiarity with various coordinate systems and associated vector calculus for describing the 

motion of particles and two-dimensional objects. 

•  Develop skills to analyze a problem, extract and combine information given in the form of text or 

diagrams. 

•  Gain familiarity with techniques for formulating and solving multi-step engineering problems and 

select an appropriate solution strategy from several possible candidates. 

•  Build an understanding of the conceptual relationship between concepts in mechanical engineering and 

electrical engineering. 

Specific Learning Objectives from the Dynamic Concept Inventory1 

•  Different points on a rigid body have different velocities and accelerations, which vary continuously.  
• 

If the net external force on a body is not zero, then the mass center must have an acceleration, and it 
must be in the same direction as the force.  

•  Angular velocities and angular accelerations are properties of the body as a whole and can vary with 

time.  

•  Rigid bodies have both translational and rotational kinetic energy.  
•  The angular momentum of a rigid body involves translational and rotational components and requires 

using some point as a reference.  

•  Points on an object that is rolling without slip have velocities and acceleration that depend on the 

rolling without slip condition.  
In general, total mechanical energy is not conserved during an impact.  

• 
•  An object can have (a) nonzero acceleration and zero velocity or (b) nonzero velocity and no 

acceleration.  

•  The inertia of a body affects its acceleration.  
•  The direction of the friction force on a rolling rigid body is not related in a fixed way to the direction of 

rolling.  

•  A particle accelerates when moving with a relative velocity on a rotating object.

Calendar Course Description 

This  Newtonian  mechanics  course  considers  the  interactions  that  influence  2-D,  curvilinear  motion.  These 
interactions are described in terms of the concepts of force, work, momentum, and energy. Initially, the focus is 
on the kinematics and kinetics of particles. Then, the kinematics and kinetics of systems of particles and solid 
bodies are examined. Finally, simple harmonic motion is discussed. The occurrence of dynamic motion in natural 
systems, such as planetary motion, is emphasized. Applications to engineered systems are also introduced. 

Calculator 

During the exam and midterm tests, students must use one of the following non-programmable calculators: 

Casio FX-991 (EX recommended; any suffix is acceptable, including ES, PLUS, ES PLUSC, MS, 
MSPLUS2) 
Sharp EL-W516 (any suffix is acceptable, including TBSL, XG, XGB-SL) 

Additional information and updates can be found on the First-Year Office website

Quercus), or see any one of the instructors or TA’s during office hours. 

Quercus website 

The course website is on Quercus,  https://q.utoronto.ca/ 
Note that most information for this course will be posted on Quercus under the heading of lecture section L0101 
– the posted information applies to ALL lecture sections of this course. 
The course website will have available: contact information for your instructor and teaching assistants; some extra 
(not  graded)  problems  and  their  solutions;  midterm  room  assignments;  details  on  the  course  outline  and  any 
announcements made in class.  It  will also have your midterm grades listed.  Students will be responsible for 
checking the course website to ensure that midterm grades have been recorded accurately. 

Online assignments 

This course requires the completion of 10 weekly assignments. These will be accessible (and answers must be 
submitted) through the WileyPlus website. To register on WileyPlus, you need to access your course on Quercus.  

At the start of the term, use the instructions on Page 8 of this handout to register for our course.  

Be sure to use your proper UofT registration name and UofT email address. 
Each Wednesday night at 11:59 pm, starting January 10th 2024, there will be a list of assigned problems, which 
must be solved and submitted on-line by the next Sunday night at 11:59 pm (see the calendar) eleven days after, 
e.g., the first assignment is released on January 10, 2024 and is due January 21, 2024 at 11:59pm. These problems 
will generate a different set of input data for each student and so copying from each other will not work, but you 
are  encouraged  to  work  with  your  friends  and  TAs  (see  tutorial  information  below)  to  fully  understand  the 

page 4  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
problem; this should then allow you to complete your individual calculations.  You will be given up to unlimited 
chances (although too many efforts may result in a lockout from WileyPlus that is outside of MIE100 settings) to 
enter the correct answer for each problem. This should give you an opportunity to correct any small calculation 
errors and will be a good inspiration for thorough checking. Once the assignment is submitted, you cannot change 
your answers. 
If you must miss an assignment for any legitimate reason, a petition and supporting documents must be submitted 
to the First-Year Office.

At each tutorial, an old quiz or midterm or exam question will be distributed and students will have some time to 
work on it alone. This is intended to give you lots of practice under exam/test-like conditions. After this initial 
exercise, you will be free to continue working on the problem with your classmates and the TAs will be there to 
help. If there is a clarification needed for many students, a TA will give a small presentation. Halfway into the 
tutorial, all students should have a firm grasp of the exam question and its solution. 
Thereafter, the tutorial will be a work session for your assignments. Although answers must be submitted on-line, 
dynamics problems are best solved with a pencil and paper. You should bring a copy of your assignment to the 
tutorial (or a copy of the problems you are having difficulty with) where you will be free to work with your friends 
and get individual help from the TA’s. The print version of the assignments will be enabled on the  WileyPlus 
website. Finally, the tutorial will serve as a time to get help with posted weekly suggested problems as well.  
Please stick to your assigned tutorial section. You should get to know your TA’s and desks are limited in all 
sections. Your TAs will provide you with their email addresses during the tutorials. These will also be posted on 
Quercus. 

Petitions for term course work 

Petitions for special consideration for term work (quiz, mid-term test, or weekly assignments) must be 
submitted directly to the First-Year Office. Do not submit them to your TA or instructor. 
(https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/petitions/about-petitions/) 

Office hours 

If you need help with Dynamics problems, you can talk with your TAs and attend the office hours for 
instructors (page 2). These are great option to get a visual demonstration of the problem.  You can also use 
Piazza, which is a useful platform to share your questions and insights with your classmates and instructors.
