1. The 7.5 rn-long timber floor beam, having a 180x180 mm square cross-section (a = 180 mm), is loaded 
as shown. Because only 5 rn-long timbers are available, the beam was fabricated from two pieces 
connected together by a nailed joint, D. You are required to: 

In the space provided, draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam, indicating the 

values at points A, B, and C, and any potential local maxima and minima; 

If the distance b = 4.2 rn, determine whether the location selected for joint D is advantageous, knowing 

that nailed joints are strong in shear but weak in bending. 

If wood has a strength of 20 MPa in both tension and compression, determine whether the beam as 

designed can carry the loads safely? What is the implied load factor?

2. A vertical section of an oil sump is shown. The access plate at the bottom covers a rectangular opening 
which has dimensions of 600x400 mm. Calculate the total force R exerted by the oil on the plate and the 
location x of R. If the plate is attached to the sump wall with two bolts at A and two bolts at B, calculate 
the force in each of the bolts. The distance from the centre of the bolts to the edge of the wall opening is 
75 mm (i.e. AB = 750 mm). The oil has a density of 900 kg/ni3.

3. Neglecting the weight of the members, determine the magnitude of the pin reaction force components at 
B, D and E when the frame illustrated is loaded by the couple shown. Show your final answers on a

4. The window below has a mass of 20 kg, which acts at the geometric centre of the window, at G. The 
window is attached at A and B by two hinges which can be idealized as ball-and-socket supports. Find all 
forces acting on the window when it is held open in the position shown by the rope attached to it at C. The 
hinge at B has been modified to allow translation along its own axis of rotation (i.e. in the x direction).

5. Determine the force in members BC, CJ, If, FH and HI, and state if the members are in tension or 
compression. From a different loading condition than that shown, the tension force in member DF has a 
magnitude of 31.4 kN, and this member is fabricated using a circular solid section made of steel with a 
yield stress of 200 IviPa and a modulus of elasticity of 200,000 MPa. Knowing that the load factor for 
members in axial tension is 2.0, determine the minimum diameter of the circular cross-section, d, such that 
member DF is safe. The diameter of the section can be selected in 0.20 mm increments. Also, what is the 
elongation of member DF, as designed?
