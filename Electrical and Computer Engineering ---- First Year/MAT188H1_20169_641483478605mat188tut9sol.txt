1. Let A =



.

(a) Find det(A).

(b) For what values of c is A invertible?

(c) For the values of c such that A is invertible, ﬁnd det(A−1).

Solution:

(a) We compute det(A) by cofactor expansion along the second row:

det(A) = c · det

(cid:21)
(cid:20)1 −1
2 −4

− 5 · det

(cid:20)1

(cid:21)

= −2c + 10

For the ﬁnal equality we used the (hopefully!) familiar formula det

(cid:21)

(cid:20)a b
d
c

= ad − bc.

(b) We recall one of the most important properties of the determinant: A is invertible if and only if
det(A) (cid:54)= 0. In our case, it follows from part (a) that A is invertible iﬀ −2c + 10 (cid:54)= 0. In other words,
A is invertible iﬀ c (cid:54)= 5.

(c) Whenever A is invertible (i.e. when c (cid:54)= 5), we have

det(A−1) =

det(A)

=

−2c + 10

We will do a cofactor expansion of these determinants along the ﬁrst row. Observe that the cofactors
along the ﬁrst row are all equal:

c1,j(X) = c1,j(Y ) = c1,j(Z),

for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n

Indeed, for each of these cofactors we remove row 1 and column j. Row 1 is the only place where
X, Y, Z diﬀer, so we get the same result in all cases. Then

det(X) = (u1 + v1)c1,1(X) + (u2 + v2)c1,2(X) + . . . + (un + vn)c1,n(X)

= (u1c1,1(X) + u2c1,2(X) + . . . unc1,n(X)) + (v1c1,1(X) + v2c1,2(X) + . . . + vnc1,n(X))
= (u1c1,1(Y ) + u2c1,2(Y ) + . . . unc1,n(Y )) + (v1c1,1(Z) + v2c1,2(Z) + . . . + vnc1,n(Z))
= det(Y ) + det(Z)

(a) Show that W is a subspace of R4.

(b) Find a basis for W and determine dim(W ).

Solution:

(a) We provide two methods for solving this problem.

Method 1: Expand the determinant in the deﬁnition of W , e.g. using cofactor expansion along the
ﬁrst row. Then we (eventually!) get the linear equation −x1 + x3 = 0. W is the set of solutions to
this equation, so it is a subspace of R4.

Method 2: We apply the subspace test. Suppose that x =

Method 1: We saw above that W is the set of solutions to the equation −x1 +x3 = 0. The parametric
form for the solutions to this equation gives us, in the usual way, a basis for W

Method 1

The area of P is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by row vectors represent-

ing the parallelogram’s sides.

In this case, one side is v1 =

, and the other side is

(cid:21)

(cid:20)1 − (−2)

(cid:21)
(cid:20)3

, so our matrix has rows equal to these vectors:

(cid:21)
(cid:20) 3

Then area(P ) = |det(A)| = |det

First we shift P to the origin by translating all points by (2, −1). This is clearly an area-preserving trans-
formation, and we get the parallelogram P (cid:48) above.

Let T by the linear transformation that maps the unit square to P (cid:48). Let A be the matrix satisfying
T (x) = Ax. Then area(P (cid:48)) = |det(A)|.

T maps the unit square as follows:



(0, 0) (cid:55)→ (0, 0)
(1, 0) (cid:55)→ (3, 5)

A Linearity Property of the Determinant Function

For an n × n matrix A you can think of det(A) as a function of the n rows of A. More precisely, if all the
rows of A except one are ﬁxed, then det(A) is a linear transformation of that one row/vector variable.

Suppose the 1st row of A is allowed to vary but the remaining rows are held ﬁxed. Say,

A =

Then,

and

T (cU ) = cT (U ), for all scalars c and all U ∈ Rn (as a row vector not a column vector)

(1)

T (U + V ) = T (U ) + T (V ), for all U, V ∈ Rn (again, as row vectors not column vectors)

(2)

In other words, T is a linear transformation! (1) is Theorem 4, on page 267 of the textbook, and (2) is
what you’re asked to prove in question 3(a). Notice there is nothing special about allowing the ﬁrst row to
vary and holding all other rows ﬁxed, we could just as easily let the j-th row vary and hold all the others
rows ﬁxed. Note that same result is true for the columns of A - i.e. we may replace the word ”row” with
”column” above.
