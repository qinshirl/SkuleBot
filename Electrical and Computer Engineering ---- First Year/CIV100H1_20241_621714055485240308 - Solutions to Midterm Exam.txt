3a. Two grooved discs, rigidly connected to each other, are subjected to the belt tension forces as shown. 
If the single resultant force, R, of these applied belt forces passes through the centre of the discs, O, 
determine the magnitude and direction of R. (7 mks) 

3b. The uniform beam has a mass of 100 kg and its weight acts at the centre of the beam. To test the 
beam, the person having a mass of 50 kg acting at D exerts a pull of 150 N on the rope rigged as shown 
around the three frictionless pulleys. Determine the force supported by the pin at O. All pulleys have a 
radius of 0.1 m. (4 mks)
