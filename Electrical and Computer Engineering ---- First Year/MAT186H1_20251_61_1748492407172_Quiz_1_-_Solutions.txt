We cannot just multiply by 2𝑥 + 1, unless we take cases of when it is positive or negative.  Far more efficient 
is to use addition and subtraction to collect the terms on one side: 

2𝑥 −

3𝑥 + 3
2𝑥 + 1

≥ 0 

(2𝑥)(2𝑥 + 1) − (3𝑥 + 3)
2𝑥 + 1

≥ 0 

4𝑥2 − 𝑥 − 3
2𝑥 + 1

≥ 0 

(4𝑥 + 3)(𝑥 − 1)
2𝑥 + 1

≥ 0

Show the work for factoring - that's where the marks are. If you could not find factors, show 
attempts that did not work.

Factoring the polynomial in any of a large number of ways gets us to:

We start by breaking the left-hand side into cases.  Carefully. 

Factoring, we get 5𝑥2 + 7𝑥 − 6 = (5𝑥 − 3)(𝑥 + 2).  This lets us figure out the cases: 

|5𝑥2 + 7𝑥 − 6| = {

5𝑥2 + 7𝑥 − 6

−(5𝑥2 + 7𝑥 − 6)

𝑥 ≤ −2,   𝑥 ≥

−2 < 𝑥 <

Case I: 5𝑥2 + 7𝑥 − 6 ≥ 0  (That is, 𝑥 ≤ −2 or 𝑥 ≥ 3/5) 

5𝑥2 + 7𝑥 − 6 ≥ 𝑥2 + 9𝑥 

4𝑥2 − 2𝑥 − 6 ≥ 0 

2(2𝑥2 − 𝑥 − 3) ≥ 0 

2(2𝑥 − 3)(𝑥 + 1) ≥ 0 

Therefore, we have zeroes at 𝑥 = −1,

.  We need to use these and intersect them with our domain.

The diagram shows the domain for Case I in blue and the 
solutions to the resulting equation in red.  What we keep is 
everything that is (a) in the solution set for the final 
equation and (b) within the domain for the case. 

Therefore, we have 𝑥 ≤ −2 or 𝑥 ≥

. 

Case II: 5𝑥2 + 7𝑥 − 6 < 0  (That is, −2 < 𝑥 < 3 5⁄ ) 

−(5𝑥2 + 7𝑥 − 6) ≥ 𝑥2 + 9𝑥 

(This is the best way of dealing with the negative – put it where the definition says and then get to work.) 

 
 
 
 
 
0 ≥ 6𝑥2 + 16𝑥 − 6 

0 ≥ 2(3𝑥2 + 8𝑥 − 3) 

0 ≥ 2(3𝑥 − 1)(𝑥 + 3) 

The same approach as before yields −2 < 𝑥 ≤

We still need to take cases: 

Case I: 𝑥 ≥

4𝑥 − 14 = {

−(4𝑥 − 14) 𝑥 <

4𝑥 − 14 ≥ 𝑥2 + 9𝑥 

𝑥2 + 5𝑥 + 14 ≤ 0 

This one does not seem to factor, so we go to the quadratic equation, where we find that the discriminant is 
𝑏2 − 4𝑎𝑐 = 52 − 4(1)(14) = 25 − 56 = −29 < 0.  Therefore, the equation has no roots.  Since it is 
positive at 𝑥 = 0, it is positive for all 𝑥 and there are no solutions. 

Case II: 𝑥 <

−(4𝑥 − 14) ≥ 𝑥2 + 9𝑥 

0 ≥ 𝑥2 + 13𝑥 − 14 

0 ≥ (𝑥 + 14)(𝑥 − 1) 

The number line indicates that the solution is −14 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 1, 
all of which is within the domain for this case. 

Therefore, the solution is −14 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 1.
