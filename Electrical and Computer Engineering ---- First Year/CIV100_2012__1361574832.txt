2.  A plate in the shape of a parallelogram is subjected to the 

forces shown. Determine: 

i) 

the  moment  of  the  couple  formed  by  the  two  16  N 
forces. 

ii)  the perpendicular distance between the 10 N forces if 

the resultant of the two couples is zero. 

iii)  the  value  of  θ  if  the  resultant  couple  is  2.1  N.mm

clockwise and d is1.20 m.

3.  Three forces act on a lever as shown.  

i)  replace the three forces with an equivalent force

couple system at B. 

ii)   determine the single force which is equivalent to the
force-couple system obtained in part (a), and specify
its point of application on the lever.

4.  A crate is subjected to the forces shown. If the forces are 
to be replaced with a single equivalent force applied at a 
point on line AB, determine:
