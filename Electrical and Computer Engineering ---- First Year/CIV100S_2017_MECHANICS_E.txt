2. Two concentrated forces, each having a magnitude of P, are acting on a walkway supported by a truss, 
as illustrated. The truss is pinned at A and F. 

Find the forces in members AB, CH, CG and GHofthe truss, in terms of P; 
Members AB, CG and CH are to be constructed from Grade 606 1-T4 aluminium with a yield stress of 

110 MPa and must all have the same solid square cross-section. Assuming that P = 18 kN, determine the 
dimension of the cross-section, a, given that the material is available in 5 mm increments and the load 
factor for axia tension is 1.6; 

Knowing that the modulus of elasticity for aluminium is 70,000 MPa, determine the elongation of 

member CH, as designed.

3. The upper end of the homogenous, constant cross-section, straight bar AB leans against the frictionless 
vertical wall, at B. If the bar has a mass of 35 kg, determine the tension in cable BC and the magnitude of 
the total force exerted by the ball-and-socket joint at A.

4. The structure ABDE is used to prevent fresh water from flowing out of the long channel on the right. 
The weight of the vertical panel ABC may be neglected and BCDE is made of a steel hollow box having 
the same wall thickness all around. The density of steel is 7,850 kg/m'. Determine the reaction force 
components at the fixed base A.

5. The simply supported beam illustrated below is made of 10 mm thick plywood sheets, attached (e.g. 
glued) together to form a Box'-shaped cross-section. Both flanges have the same width, b. 

Draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam in the space reserved below, 

indicating the values at -1, B, C, D and E, as well as any potential local maxima and minima; 

Determine the width of the beam, b, such that it can safely carry the loads applied. The plywood has a 
failure stress of 40 MPa in both tension and compression and the required load factor for wood in flexure 
is 3.0. The fabrication shop can cut the plywood sheets in multiples of 10 mm.
