Instructions: Students MUST write their correct response on the final page of the test (the 
“bubble sheet”) for their grade to be valid.  Do not write your answer on this question sheet as it 
will not be graded.  The teaching team is not responsible for students failing to do this. 

Please review the question(s) carefully and submit only one (1) most-correct response.  
Each correct response is worth one (1) mark.

7. 

You are working as a Team Leader at a company manufacturing fibre optic 
components. On the evening shift, an operator cleaning their workspace with 
compressed air lodges a glass fibre in their eye. Returning from escorting the 
operator to the hospital, you inform a senior operator that a short-term replacement 
operator is needed. You learn from the senior operator that this has happened 
before “because the compressed air is too strong.” What should be your next 
action? 

a.  Research the safety standard for compressed air pressure and implement it. 

b.  Report the incident to the Engineering Manager and Shift Manager. 

c.  Retrain the operators in the proper method of clearing their workspace. 

d.  Report the incident to the CTO and COO.

10. 

An APS112 team has designed a hybrid, enclosed, all-terrain hand wagon for the 
transport, storage, and protection of a large tipi (30 ft tall). Their three objectives in 
order of importance are: 1) Reduce physical effort; 2) Weather resistant; 3) 
Inexpensive. Which is the best project plan to implement the Measures of Success?  

a.  Calculate the wagon mass. Research the tipi mass and rolling resistance 

coefficient. Calculate the rolling resistance force. 

b.  Construct a full-scale prototype. Research tipi mass. Load prototype with 

weights. Use a push-pull gauge to take measurements over a range of terrain. 

c.  Construct a one-tenth scale prototype. Demonstrate use of the design for the 

client. Ask client if they think it meets their needs. 

d.  Create a Bill of Materials. Add material cost through research. Benchmark 

assembly costs. Calculate total cost.  

11. 

Your team determines “Low Physical Effort” as a key objective in your design of a 
tipi transport solution described in Question 10. Which is the best goal? 

a.  <100 lbs -“a man can exert a pressure of 107 lbs”…when dragging an item [1]. 

b.   <80 lbf - “max male two-handed push strength is 135 lbf”; female total body 

strength is, on average 60% of male total body strength [2]. 

c.  <50 lbf - “max male two-handed push strength is 135 lbf”; female total body 

strength ranges from 35% to 85% of that max [2]. 

d.  “Operating system must account for limited hand strength” [3].

For the Assertion-Evidence style of slide design, claims: 

a.  Should be delivered primarily through spoken content. 

b.  Should be organized according to the presentation outline. 

c.  Should be stated in the header of each slide.  

d.  Should be triangulated and demonstrated through different sources of 

evidence. 

13. 

For multimodality, our lectures this term differentiated between form and content. 
According to lecture, what is the best description of how those terms relate?  

a.  The content being communicated determines the form of the communication. 

b.  Content must be made to fit the expected form of a given situation. 

c.  Audience needs should not impact the form of your communication. 

d.  Aptness for a given audience determines the project requirements you 

present. 

14. 

Three assignments, across ESP I and II, differentiate between the content we 
expect in observation and analysis sections. What is the best description of how 
observation and analysis are different?  

a.  Observation should capture every detail while analysis links parts of the 

observation together. 

b.  Observation should capture the most relevant details, while analysis links 

parts of the observation together. 

c.  Observation should use multimodality to communicate to the audience, while 

analysis should mostly be in written paragraphs. 

d.  Observation should be an objective description, while analysis explains why 

something is how it is, and why it matters. 

15. 

At the beginning of forming a team, what can the Bolton and Bolton Questionnaire 
help you to understand about your new team members? 

a.  Personality types 

b.  Cross-cultural communication strategies 

c.  Working styles

b.  1x106 L 

c.  1x109 L 

d.  1x1012 L
