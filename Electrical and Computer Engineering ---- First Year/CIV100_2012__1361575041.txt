1.  Determine the second moments 
of  areas  (i.e.,  moments  of 
inertias)  of  the  cross  sections 
(a)  and  (b)  for  bending  about 
their  centroidal  x  and  y  axes. 
Determine  the  centroids  of  the 
cross sections with reference to 
origin  O.  (You  may  obtain  the 
centroid  location  of  (a)  from 
Problem Set 9.)

2.  Beam ABCDE, supported by a 

fixed connection at A, an internal pin at B and a 
roller at C, is subjected to a uniformly-distributed 
load  and  two  point loads  as  shown  in  figure  (a). 
The beam is to be constructed from the structural 
steel  with the  yield  strength  of  350  MPa  in  both 
tension and compression. 

i.)   Neatly  draw  the  shear  and  bending  moment 
diagrams  for  beam  ABCD  and  indicate  all 
key values. 

ii.)  Beam  ABCD  is  to  be  designed  using  a 
uniform-thickness  hollow  structural  steel 
section  shown  in  figure  (b).  Using  a  load 
factor  of  1.9,  determine 
the  minimum 
thickness  t  required.    Thicknesses  are  only 
available in 2 mm increments.

3.  The maximum internal service moment on a beam is calculated to be 50 kNm. This beam is to 
be designed for a load factor of 2.0 and using a channel section having the yield stress of 300 
MPa in both tension and compression.  

i.)   Select a suitable section to minimize the material cost. 

ii.)  Select  a  suitable  section to  minimize  the  depth  of the  beam  due to  an  overhead  clearance 

requirement enforced by the city.
