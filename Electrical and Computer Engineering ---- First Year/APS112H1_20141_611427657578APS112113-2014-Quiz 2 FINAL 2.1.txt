1.  For a finished, marketed design of a hairdryer in Canada, what would be LEAST affected by the 

method of connection of the two halves of the hairdryer shell: 

a.  Aesthetics (how it looks) 
b.  Safety 
c.  Ease of Assembly 
d.  Ease of Repair 
e.  Cost of Parts 

2.  For a simplistic design, there are two possible failure modes: 

i. 
ii. 

that has a probability of happening of .1 and a cost if it happens of 10, and 
that has a probability of happening of .2 and a cost if it happens of 8 

So the risk involved with this design is 

a. 
.02 
b. 
.3 
c.  1.3 
d.  2.6 
e.  18 

Questions 3 through 5 refer to the chart of Cost versus Time show below: 

Budget 

Actual 

The longer line on the chart is the budgeted costs as the project goes through the proposed schedule of 
tasks; the shorter line tracks the costs that have been incurred as the tasks have actually been 
completed. NOW shows the place that the proposed schedule indicates the project should be. 

3.  The Budgeted Cost of Work Performed would be closest to: 

a.  3.0 
b.  1.1 
.95 
c. 
.8 
d. 
.7 
e.

4.  The Cost Performance Index would be closest to: 

a. 
.8/1.1 
b.  1.1/.8 
.95/.7 
c. 
.7/.95 
d. 
.7-.95 
e. 

5.  A reasonable estimate, based on current performance plus assuming that the rest of the 

schedule is correct, is that the project will finish: 

a.  On time, on budget 
b.  Early, with a cost overrun of .3 
c.  Early, with costs being under the projection by .3 
d.  Late, with a cost overrun of .3 
e.  Late, with costs being under the projection by .3 

6.  The Utility Patent covering improvements on the Frisbee flying disc claimed: 
a.  The ornamental design of a more marketable version of the Frisbee. 
b.  A flying disc with a set of ridges to modify the airflow on the convex side. 
c.  The dimensions and specific grade of polymer needed to manufacture the disc.  
d.  The trademarked name “Wham-O Frisbee.” 
e.  None of the above answers is correct. 

7.  The Design of the Icon A5 light sport aircraft involved a detailed analysis of the potential 

customers for the plane.  The core of the method was: 

a.  An extensive survey of existing pilots to see what features they would want in a new 

plane.  

b.  A series of focus groups each involving a different demographic.    
c.  An internal discussion with employees of the company voting for the features that they 

thought would be most desirable.  

d.  Estimating/guessing the opinion of five fictitious customers from five different potential 

markets.  

e.  All of the above are false: The configuration of the plane was governed entirely by 
engineering performance considerations, since the performance of the plane was 
considered to be the most important selling feature.  

8.  John Quinlan has an issued (granted) U.S. Utility Patent, which he applied for on June 3, 1999.   
The patent covers a special dual handled cooking knife, but you have just found a French patent 
from 1975 with the exact same configuration as Quinlan’s invention.   

Which of the following four statements is most correct as of today’s date (2014): 

a.  Quinlan should call his lawyers. He might be infringing on the 1975 patent and could 

have to pay damages. 

b.  Quinlan’s patent will protect his intellectual property and cannot be challenged, since it 

was granted by the U.S. patent office.

c.  Quinlan has protection for the ornamental design of the knife only. 
d.  The French Patent serves as prior art that could be used to strike down Quinlan’s patent 

in a court challenge. 

9. 

In one sense, the Pugh Selection Matrix is better than the Weighted Decision Matrix for choosing 
the best design alternative because: 

It provides a numerical score proportional to performance. 
It allows for a simple pairwise comparison between alternatives. 
It can be done in one pass and is therefore quicker. 

a. 
b. 
c. 
d.  None of the above. 

10. The “bathtub curve” refers to a widely observed trend in reliability engineering.  It describes: 

a.  The relative failure rate of components during the first part, middle part and end part of 

their lifetime. 

The rate of return on an investment in a Quality Engineering program. 

b.  The quality resulting from low, medium and high levels of expense and effort.   
c. 
d.  The relationship between the number of failures and the number of customer returns. 
e. 

The slope of the bottom of a bathtub needed to effectively drain the water.  

11. Codes and Standards govern many aspects of engineering where failure might have an adverse 

effect on the public.   Which of these statements (a, b c, or d) is FALSE: 
a.  Codes may specify materials to be used for a specific part. 
b.  Codes are often based on experience with past failures.  
c. 
d.  None of the statements above are false.  [Choose (d) if a, b, and c are all true.] 

Codes can make it difficult to introduce new engineering solutions for existing problems. 

12. An electric cutoff saw is manufactured for home use.  Which of the following statements is 

FALSE: 

a.  A blade guard should rotate into place when the saw is in the up position.   
b.  A two-button sequence should be used to prevent children from operating the saw  

accidentally.  

c.  A warning label should be placed near the blade to indicate the possibility of cutting your 

fingers off.  

d.  The User Manual should instruct users to wear eye protection when using the saw. 
e.  None of the statements above are false.  [Choose (e) if a, b, c and d are all true.]

Written Answer (marks per question as indicated on question; 18 marks total) 

13.  (3 marks) The diagram below is called a ________________________ diagram. 

Sketch a two-point perspective drawing of the block depicted below.  Assume that it measures                  
5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm and that it is sitting on the desk in front of you with three faces (top, front, and side) 
visible.  Assume further that in the sketch, none of the faces is in the plane of the paper.  Show 
construction lines if you use them.

The remaining questions (14 - 18) deal with the following problem statement: 

You are asked to design an ice and snow scraper for cleaning a car windshield.  It will have adjustable 
length, a snowbrush and windshield squeegee at one end, and a scraper at the other end.  The existing 
product from a competitor is shown in the figure below and has all of these features.  It is made from 
aluminum tubing, plastic molded parts, rubber, foam and nylon bristles.  Your company would like to sell 
the new version at a hefty profit so your boss asks you to rethink the whole thing to minimize 
manufacturing costs and to maximize profitability. 

14. (4 marks) Describe (briefly) two general principles of design for manufacturing and assembly, 

and indicate how you would use these principles to minimize manufacturing and assembly costs 
for the new, redesigned product.

15. (4 marks) The existing product has a stamp that says “US Patents 8,503,509 and D765098”  What 

do these numbers signify and what do they mean for your design process. 

16. (4 marks) The main tube on the existing product is made from aluminum, and your boss suggests 
using some type of injection-molded plastic to save money.  Given  a) the plastic part would be 
injection molded, and b) the heavy loads put on the device when scraping ice from the 
windshield, what challenges might you face and how would you address them.
