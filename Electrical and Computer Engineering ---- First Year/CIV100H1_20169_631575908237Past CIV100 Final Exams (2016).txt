CIV100F/APS160F	–	Mechanics:	Final	Exam	2016	

Question 1 
The structure ABCDE is used to prevent fresh water from flowing out of the long channel on the right. 
The weight of vertical panel ABC may be neglected and BCDE is made of reinforced concrete with a 
density of 2,400 kg/m3. Determine the reaction force components at the fixed base A. 

Question 3 
The hinged beam illustrated below is made of three rigid segments, connected by pins at C and E. 
(a) Draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams in the space reserved below, indicating 
the values at A, B, C, D, E, F and G, as well as any potential local maxima and minima; 
(b) The beam is made of two identical C-shaped bent plates, welded ‘toe-to-toe’ to form a hollow 
rectangle, as shown in the cross section. Before bending, each plate can be cut in multiples of 10 
mm. Determine the width, b, of the beam such that it can safely carry the loads applied. The beam 
material is Grade 6061-T4 aluminium with a yield stress of 110 MPa and the required load factor 
for flexure is 1.5. 

Question 2 
The rectangular prism is made of a solid, homogenous material having a density of 1,400 kg/m3 and must 
support a cylindrical container at C. The prism is supported by a cable DE and by ball-and-socket joints at 
A and B. The support at E lies in the x-y plane. Determine the magnitude of the force in cable ED. Express 
the force in cable ED in Cartesian vector format.

Question 5 
Illustrated below is a portal crane used in a ship-building yard. While lifting materials, the crane is 
also affected by wind loading. The forces acting on the crane from both lifting and wind are as 
illustrated. 
(a) Find the forces in members DE, DI, IK and KL of the truss; 
(b)  Member DI is to be constructed from a built-up steel hollow section constructed from four 
plates welded together, as indicated in the cross section. Determine the minimum plate thickness, 
t, considering that the material is available in one millimetre intervals. The yield stress for steel is 
350 MPa and the load factor for axial tension is 1.1; 
(c) Knowing that the modulus of elasticity for steel is 200,000 MPa, determine the elongation of 
member DI, as designed. 

Question 4 
The three straight members in the structure shown are pin-connected and the pulley is frictionless. The 
rope is attached at one end to member CD, at G. Determine the components of all the forces acting on 
member ACEF. Present your answers on a separate free-body diagram of member ACEF. Neglect the 
weight of the members and pulley.
