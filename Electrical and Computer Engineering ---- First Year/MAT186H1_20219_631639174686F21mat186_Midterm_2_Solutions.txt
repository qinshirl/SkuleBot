1.

(1 pt) Select the ONE equation, if any, that is NOT TRUE.

(a) ln(x2 + 2x + 1) − ln(x + 1) = ln(x + 1) − ln(1)

TRUE:

ln(x2 + 2x + 1) − ln(x + 1) = ln (cid:0)x + 1)2 − ln(x + 1)

= 2 ln(x + 1) − ln(x + 1) = ln(x + 1) − 0

= ln(x + 1) − ln(1)

(b) ln(ex23) = x + 3 ln(2)

TRUE:

(c) eln(x+2) ln(x) = (x + 2)ln(x)

TRUE:

ln(ex23) = ln(ex) + ln(23) = x + 3 ln(2).

(Notice also that eln(x+2) ln(x) = (eln(x))ln(x+2) = xln(x+2))

eln(x+2) ln(x) = (eln(x+2))ln(x) = (x + 2)ln(x)

(d) 2 ln( x
FALSE:

x+1 ) = (ln(x) − ln(x + 1))2

2 ln(

x
x + 1

) = 2(cid:0) ln(x) − ln(x + 1)(cid:1) = ln(x2) − ln(x + 1)2

̸= (ln(x) − ln(x + 1))2 = (ln(x))2 − 2 ln(x) ln(x + 1) + (ln(x + 1))2

(1 pt) Select the ONE expression that is a solution to the following initial value problem.

(cid:40) dy

dt = −(t + 1)2y2et
y(0) = 1

(a) y(t) = 0

(c) y(t) =

(b) y(t) =

e−t
t2 + 1
e−t
t + 1
(d) y(t) = e−t/2
(e) t = −1

We can immediately eliminate (a.) as it does not satisfy the initial condition (even though a
general solution to the differential equation) and (e.) as it is a value of time not a function of
time. Notice also that (d.) satisfies the differential equation

Hence we see that the answer is (b.).

(1 pt) Consider the initial value problem

= t + y

dy
dt
y(0) = 2.

Estimate y(4) using Euler’s method with a step-size h = 1.

(a) y(4) ≈ 19

(b) y(4) ≈ 23

(c) y(4) ≈ 43

(d) y(4) ≈ 47

(e) y(4) ≈ 90

We shall use the Euler formula

yn+1 = yn + (tn + yn) · h,

where y0 = 2 and tn+1 = tn + 1 with t0 = 0. We do this recursively in four steps to find y4 ≈ y(4) :

y1 = 2 + (0 + 2) · 1 = 4
y2 = 4 + (1 + 4) · 1 = 9
y3 = 9 + (2 + 9) · 1 = 20
y4 = 20 + (3 + 20) · 1 = 43.

Thus, y(4) ≈ 43 that is the correct answer is (c.).

(1 pt) Fred decides to raise alpacas on his farm. Let W (x) be the amount of wool, in kilograms per
year, produced by an alpaca who was fed x kilograms of food per day. Select the ONE sentence
that gives a valid interpretation of the statement W ′(4) = 0.7.

(a) To increase an alpaca’s wool production from 4 kilograms per year to 4.6 kilograms per year,

Fred should feed it about 0.42 extra kilograms of food per day.

(b) To increase a alpaca’s wool production from 4 kilograms per year to 4.1 kilograms per year,

Fred should feed it approximately 0.7 more kilograms of food per day.

(c) An alpaca that is fed 4.3 kilograms of food per day instead of 4 kilograms of food per day

will produce approximately 0.21 additional kilograms of wool per year.

(d) An alpaca that is fed 4.1 kilograms of food per day instead of 4 kilograms of food per day

will produce approximately 0.7 additional kilograms of wool per year.

(e) An alpaca that is fed 4 kilograms of food per day will produce 0.7 kilograms of wool per year.

Options (a) and (b) are eliminated because 4 represents food and 0.7 represents wool, not the
other way around. Option (e) is eliminated because it represents the statement W (4) = 0.7 about
the original function, not the derivative. The derivative W ′(4) represents the instantaneous rate
at which wool production would respond in changes to food delivery. This rate is 0.7 kg wool per
additional kg of food. Since in option (c), we increase food by 0.3 kilograms, wool would increase
approximately

0.3 kg food ·

0.7 kg wool
kg food

= 0.21 kg wool.

Option (d) is incorrect because if we increased food by 0.1 kg, that would cause wool to increase
by approximately 0.1 · 0.7 = 0.07 kg.

You can also think of this in terms of the linear approximation ∆W = W ′(4)∆X.

(1 pt) You were feeling adventurous and you agreed to go skydiving with your friend. After jumping
from the plane, your speed (in metres) for the first 90 seconds was given by the following function:

f (t) =

(cid:40)

58(1 − e−t/3),
0 ≤ t ≤ 45
(53 − 58e−15)e90−2t + 5, 45 < t ≤ 90

(before opening the parachute)
(after opening the parachute)

Which approach, if any, gives an approximation that guarantees an underestimate of the distance
that you traveled in the first 90 seconds?

(a) Using a left-endpoint Riemann sum for the interval [0, 90]

(b) Using a right-endpoint Riemann sum for the interval [0, 90]

(c) Using a left-endpoint Riemann sum for t ∈ [0, 45] and a right-endpoint Riemann sum for

t ∈ [45, 90]

(d) Using a right-endpoint Riemann sum for t ∈ [0, 45] and a left-endpoint Riemann sum for

t ∈ [45, 90]

(e) More information is required to guarantee an underestimate.

We recall that on an interval, the left-hand sum is an over-estimate if the function is strictly
decreasing and an underestimate if the sum is strictly increasing. The opposite is true for the
right-hand sum, namely overestimate if the function is strictly increasing and an underestimate
if the function is strictly decreasing. We calculate the derivatives on the separate intervals,

f ′(t) = +

e−t/3 > 0 for

t ∈ [0, 45]

and

f ′(t) = −2(53 − 58e−15)e90−2t < 0

for

t ∈ [45, 90]

Hence from the above dialogue concerning under/over-estimates, if we want an underestimate
over [0, 90] then we want to use a left-endpoint Riemann sum for t ∈ [0, 45] and a right-endpoint
Riemann sum for t ∈ [45, 90]. Thus the answer is (c).

(e) None of the above

We see that (c) definitely cannot be a limit of Riemann sums. Option (b) is also eliminated because
the width ∆x of the interval is wrong. Option (d) is also eliminated because the leftmost and
rightmost ‘endpoints’ (3j/n when j = 2 and when j = n + 1) would not converge to 2 and 5.
By reindexing, option (a) is indeed a correct limit of a right-endpoint Riemann sum. Hence the
correct answer is (a).

(5 pts total) A rectangle expands such that its length is always twice as long as its width. (This
statement applies to parts (a), (b), and (c).)

(a) (1 pt) When its width is growing at 5 cm per minute, at what rate is its length increasing?

Let’s call the width W and the length L. Then from the above statement we note that L = 2W .

(b) (2 pts) When its width is equal to 7 cm, and the width is growing at 5 cm per minute, at what
rate is the area of this rectangle increasing? (You do not have to simplify your answer)

dt = 5 cm

Here we are again given that dW
dt =? when W = 7cm. Re-
call that L = 2W so L = 14 at this particular moment. As in part (a), differentiating L = 2W
with respect to time we get dL
Differentiating the area A = W L with respect to time, using the product rule and plugging
in our known quantities gives

section of a cylinder, so that the length of the rectangle is the height of the cylinder and the
width of the rectangle is the diameter of the circular end of the cylinder.

When the height of this cylinder is 20 cm and is increasing at 30 cm per minute, at what rate
is its volume expanding? (You do not have to simplify your answer)

First, lets recall that a cylinder of height h and base radius r has a volume of

V = πr2h.

(4 pts total) Fred is building a rectangular pen1 for his alpacas2. He will use the an existing rock
wall as part of his pen. The existing rock wall consists of a 15 meter segment forming a corner
with a 45 meter segment. The entire rock wall must be used as part of the pen.

(a) (2 pts) If Fred has 140 meters of wooden fencing to add, what is the area of the largest pen
he can build? (the drawing does not necessarily reflect what the optimal case looks like)

Fence

45m

Rock wall

15m

We first define the horizontal part of our rectangular pen by x and the vertical part of our
pen by y. Then the area of our rectangular pen is given by A = x · y. We will now take note
that we have a constraint on the perimeter P = 140m, which is written in term of x and y as

140 = P = x + (x − 15) + y + (y − 45) =⇒ x + y = 100.

Hence we want to optimize the area A = x · y subject to the constraint x + y = 100. We now
substitute our constraint into the area function so that A = A(x) and we want to maximize
the function

A(x) = x · (100 − x) = 100x − x2

15 ≤ x ≤ 55.

Notice the range in x ∈ [15, 55] is required since the entire rock wall must be used. Clearly x
must be at least as large as the horizontal part of the wall, 15m. To see why x can’t be bigger
than 55m, substitute in the smallest possible y-value, 45m, into the constraint equation
x + y − 100.
Then we check for critical points by taking the derivative

A′(x) = 100 − 2x = 0 =⇒ x = 50 ∈ [15, 55].

Therefore the global maximum on this interval could be at x = 50 or at one of the endpoints
x = 15 or x = 55. Notice that A′(x) = 100−2x > 0 when x < 50 and A′(x) = 100−2x < 0 when
x > 50. Hence by the first derivative test this point is indeed a local maximum. Moreover,
the function increases from x = 15 to x = 50, and decreases from x = 50 to x = 55. Thus,
the area is maximized when x = y = 50 with an area of

1A pen is a fenced-in area for animals.
2An alpaca is a cute and fuzzy animal.

A(20) = 50 · 50 = 2, 500.

Area of the pen: 2500m2

You could also compare the critical point the endpoints (A(15), A(50), and A(55)) to see
which has the largest value, but this requires more multiplication by hand.

(b) (2 pts) If instead Fred only has 110 meters of wooden fencing to add, what is the area of the

largest pen he can build?

The setup is the same, albeit with different constraint on the perimeter P = 110m, which is
written in term of x and y as

110 = P = x + (x − 15) + y + (y − 45) =⇒ x + y = 85.

Hence we want to optimize the area A = x · y subject to the constraint x + y = 85. We now
substitute our constraint into the area function so that A = A(x) and we want to maximize
the function

A(x) = x · (85 − x) = 85x − x2

15 ≤ x ≤ 40.

We check for critical points by taking the derivative

A′(x) = 85 − 2x = 0 =⇒ x = 85/2.

Notice that x = 85/2 = 42.5 > 40, which is outside our interval. Hence we compare the
endpoints

A(15) = 15 · 60 = 10 · 60 + 5 · 60 = 600 + 300 = 900.

A(40) = 40 · 45 = 20 · 90 = 1800.

Hence by the extreme value theorem, the max area is given by 1800 when x = 40 and y = 45.

Area of the pen:1800m2

(5 pts total) Lego Batman has been trapped by Scarecrow. Scarecrow has created a new liquid
called Globbo that behaves like water but stays in a perfect sphere even under gravity.

Batman has been thrown into a sphere of Globbo. The Globbo sphere is evaporating at a rate
proportional to its surface area (with constant of proportionality α) and Batman wants to know
how long it will take for it to get small enough to manage the situation.

(a) (3 pts) At first, Lego Batman decides to figure out how quickly the mass of the liquid is shrink-
ing. He knows that the density of Globbo is 2,000 kg/m3 and that the sphere had a radius
of 3 m when he was thrown into it. Find a differential equation and initial condition for the
mass that uses only the following unknowns: mass, time, and the constant of proportionality.

Let the density be given by ρ = 2, 000 kg
m3 and we recall that the volume of a sphere V = 4π
where R is the radius of a sphere. The mass M = M (t) is related to these quantities via

3 R3

M = ρV =

4ρπ
3

R3 kg

m3 =⇒ R =

(cid:16) 3M
4ρπ

(cid:17)1/3

.

Recall that the surface area of a sphere is A = 4πR2. Since the volume is changing in-
time proportional( with constant α) to the surface area A, we have dV
dt = αA. Then, after
differentiating M = ρV in-time and substituting, we have

dM
dt

= ρ

dV
dt

= ραA = 4ρπαR2 = (ρ)(α)(4π

(cid:16) 3M
4ρπ

(cid:17)2/3

)

From our original relationship between the radius R and mass M , we see that the initial
mass M (0) at R = 3 m satisfies

M (0) =

4ρπ
3

(3 m)3 kg

m3 = 36ρπ kg.

Differential equation: dM

dt = (ρ)(α)(4π

(cid:16) 3M
4ρπ

(cid:17)2/3

)

Initial condition: M (0) = 36ρπ kg

There are two other valid interpretations of the differential equation. One is that you could
have assumed ‘evaporation’ means dM
dt = αA; in this case your solution
would simply be missing the one factor of ρ out front. The other is that you could have
assumed α had to be positive so you put −α to represent a decreasing volume.

dt = αA instead of dV

11

(b) (2 pts) After getting the first result, Batman tries a new approach and wants to figure out the
radius of the sphere. Find a differential equation for the radius that uses only the following
unknowns: radius, time, and the constant of proportionality.

In order to find the differential equation for the Radius R = R(t) we differentiate V = 4
in terms of time.

3 πR3

dV
dt

= 4πR2 dR

Then, since we are given dV
to one another.

dt = αA = α4πR2, we can set these two expressions for dV

dt equal

4πR2 dR
dt
dR
dt

=⇒

= α4πR2

= α

Differential equation: dR

dt = α

If you assumed dM
dt = αA instead of dV
also have a negative sign in front of α.

dt = αA, your solution would be dR

dt = α/ρ. You may
