Note:  The term work component* (40%) will be normalised in each section to an average of 70%;  

i.e. to 28 out of 40; 
The midterm and final examinations are common for all sections of CIV100F. 

Calculators:   The quizzes and the final examination will be "closed-book"; i.e., no aids are allowed except for a  

non-programmable calculator. This rule will be strictly enforced and the only permissible non- 
programmable  calculators  are  (leading  and  trailing  letters  before  or  after  a  model  number  are 
irrelevant):  

Casio FX991 

Sharp EL520 

Important:  Absolutely no other calculators will be allowed during tests and examinations. 

Textbook: 

Hibbeler R.C. and Yap, K.B. (2013). "Mechanics for Engineers – Statics”, 13th. Edition, 
SI Edition, Pearson.  Notes on three topics dealing with strength of materials (July 2011) 
are  available  for  download  from  Blackboard.  Students  taking  MIE100S  should  purchase 
both the statics and dynamics textbooks, along with the notes.

Some Important Notes about the Assigned Problem Sets and Quizzes: 

- 2 - 

1. Assignments must be done neatly, in pencil, on one side only of the engineering problem paper which is 
sold in pads by the Engineering Stores located in the basement of the Sandford Fleming Building. No other paper 
will be accepted. A straight edge is required for drawing lines, but scales and protractors are not mandatory. A good 
eraser is invaluable. Lack of neatness may be penalised. 

2. The assigned problem sheet will be handed out during each tutorial period. The solution must include all 
necessary diagrams and calculations. The pages of the completed problem set, including the original problem sheet 
as the last page, must be stapled together. Problem sets fastened with paper clips or by folding the corners of paper 
will not be accepted. 

3. Completed assignments must be submitted at the beginning of the lecture on the following Monday by 

2:10 pm. Late assignments will normally not be assessed. 

4.  Each  assigned  problem  set  will  contain  four  or  more  problems  which  all  must  be  attempted.  Of  all 
problems,  only  one  question  (selected  randomly)  will  be  marked.  However,  if  not  all  assigned  problems  are 
attempted in an assignment, a zero mark will be assigned to that particular problem set. 

5. The quizzes will each be one hour long and will be held during the tutorial period on the date announced 

under “Basis of Final Grade”. 

6. The midterm examination, common for all sections, will be 1-½ hours long, and will be held between 12 

and 2 pm on the date announced under “Basis of Final Grade”. 

7. The date of the final examination, also common for all sections, will be known sometime in November. 

8. Cell phones and any other portable electronic equipment are forbidden during tests and exams. 

9.  A  final  note:  Plagiarism  is  a  serious  academic  offence;  sanctions  can  range  from  a  zero  mark  to 

expulsion from the university program and a note on your transcript.
