Two good solutions exist.  We can substitute for 𝑥 + 2 (that is the solution shown 
here), but it would actually be much better to use √𝑥 + 2.  Try that one 
yourselves. 

Let 𝑢 = 𝑥 + 2, so 𝑑𝑢 = 𝑑𝑥.

2.  Find the area of the region between 𝒚 = |𝒙| and 𝒚 = 𝟔 − |𝟐𝒙|. 

We need to take cases: 

|𝑥| = {

−𝑥,
𝑥,

𝑥 < 0
𝑥 ≥ 0

          6 − |2𝑥| = {

6 + 2𝑥,
6 − 2𝑥,

𝑥 < 0
𝑥 ≥ 0

These will intersect at 𝑥 = ±2.  So, we need to find the area using two integrals (we 
could use symmetry and just double one of them):

𝐴 = ∫ (6 + 2𝑥) − (−𝑥)

3.  A spherical snowball melts at a rate that is proportional to its surface area.

Show that the rate of change of the radius is constant. 

We are given that

This definitely requires the Squeeze Theorem, with positive and negative cases. 

Case I: 𝑥 − 2 > 0, or 𝑥 > 2. 

−1 ≤ cos (

1

(𝑥 − 2)2) ≤ 1 
1

−(𝑥 − 2) ≤ (𝑥 − 2) cos (

(𝑥 − 2)2) ≤ (𝑥 − 2) 

Therefore, by the Squeeze Theorem, the limit in case I goes to zero. 

lim
𝑥→2

−(𝑥 − 2) = lim
𝑥→2

(𝑥 − 2) = 0 

Case II is nearly identical and we can get away with saying “Case II is done similarly.”  Here it is in 
full: 

Case II: 𝑥 − 2 < 0, or 𝑥 < 2. 

−1 ≤ cos (

1

(𝑥 − 2)2) ≤ 1 
1

−(𝑥 − 2) ≥ (𝑥 − 2) cos (

(𝑥 − 2)2) ≥ (𝑥 − 2) 

lim
𝑥→2

−(𝑥 − 2) = lim
𝑥→2

(𝑥 − 2) = 0 

Therefore, by the Squeeze Theorem, the limit in case II goes to zero. 

Therefore, the limit is zero.
