Multiple Choice Questions (1 mark each; total of 14 marks) 
For multiple choice questions, you must use the multiple choice answer sheet provided – fill in your 

name and student number. Follow the directions on the sheet carefully to ensure that you receive 
marks for the correct answer. You should mark only the single, most correct answer for each 
question. Always mark the answer in the spot corresponding to the question number. Use a 
pencil. Erase any errors completely. There is no deduction for wrong answers.

2. 

At arrow #1, task #2 takes 3 days but extends over 5 days. This could be because of (choose the 
most complete answer):

the task goes longer 

b.  that task #2 the resources involved in the task are not available weekends 
c.  task #2 is more difficult than was first planned so the actual time is taking longer

You are working on a project to create a recreational space in a shelter for homeless women and 
one of the requirements is a smoking area. One of your team members, Lee, has ethical concerns 
about this and says, “Smoking is unhealthy. We should not contribute to a bad habit.” The kind of 
Critical Thinking associated with the Project Requirements is shown in which of the following 
statements that you might make to Lee? 

a.  We should put it in the design because even though smoking isn’t healthy, it’s not illegal and these 

are adults.  

b.  You’re right. Let’s ask our Project Manager to talk to the client to get this requirement removed. 
c.  We should put it in the design because we have to take the context of these women’s lives into 

account. They are dealing with large problems. 

d.  We have to put it into the design, because the client has asked for it. 

10. 

 Although the belt sander-based paper folder demonstrated in lecture worked, it was ultimately a 
poor design compared to a buckle folder.  The most likely way for next year’s class to “invent” the 
buckle folder (i.e. without any prior knowledge of how it really works) is: 

a.  Get together in larger groups to produce more variability of ideas.  
b.  Use biological analogies to spark creative ideas about folding. 
c.  Attempt to mimic the manual methods as closely as possible. 
d.  Start by unstructured brainstorming to obtain the widest set of possible solutions. 
e.  Do a functional decomposition and focus on each part of the process independently.  

11. 

You are an experienced design engineer and you are asked to design a new underwater stabilizing 
fin for a luxury yacht, a field of design you are not particularly familiar with. You want the most 
efficient design with the least amount of drag. Which of the following statements is FALSE: 

a.  You should look for inspiration in other engineering designs – airplanes, windmills, hydrofoils, etc.  
b.  You should look for inspiration in nature, such as the fin of a whale. 
c.  You should employ a variety of creative thinking techniques to avoid functional fixation. 
d.  You should brainstorm possible configurations before looking at reference designs in order to 

avoid fixation. 

e.  You should start with more general references on fin design, and then build towards more specific 

references.  

12.  Design for safety is a key DFX principle. Which of the following statements is FALSE? 

a.  Designing for Safety should be left to near the end of the design process, so that a full inventory of 

potential hazards is known. 

b.  Risk depends on the severity of a hazard and the probability that it will materialize. 
c.  Safety is a highly regulated field and there are often Codes and Standards to consider. 
d.  Engineers can be held accountable for accidents if they did not display a reasonable standard of 

care in the design. 

e.  Safety factors are commonly used to reduce the probability of failure.

13. 

The theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) involves:

b.  Working in a group using a set of well defined critical questions. 
c.  Using a limited set of well-defined inventive principles to solve new problems without 

compromises. 

d.  Combining, Maximizing, and Eliminating parts of design solutions to derive new solutions.

of a design.  

14. 

You have just received a client problem statement, and it describes a problem of flooding in an 
underground parking garage owned by the client, together with a statement that the client would 
like you to source an appropriate pumping system to deal with this. Before you meet your client 
for the first time, you should: 

a.  Do a detailed search for appropriate pumps to show the client that you are well prepared for the 

job.  

b.  Do some background reading on flooding in engineered structures and the various ways to deal 

with this.  

c.  Interview some key stakeholders including the clients and maintenance staff to get the true story 

about the problem. 

d.  Brainstorm a set of design solutions and prepare a short report highlighting your preferred choice.

Written Answer (marks per question as indicated on question; 16 marks total) 

Write answers into the spaces provided on the question paper. 

Questions 15 – 17 refer to the following client statement: The client is a business person, starting up a 
new factory to make plastic snow toboggans (sleds) at the minimum possible cost. In the factory, 
1.5 mm thick sheets of plastic have to be heated to 150oC so that they are soft, and then formed 
to the shape of the toboggan (see the figure). The client asks you to design a press to allow a single 
production worker to do this.    

15. (6 MARKS) List two objectives, two constraints and two stakeholders that would be appropriate 

for this design.  

OBJECTIVES: 

CONSTRAINTS: 

STAKEHOLDERS: 

16.  (2 MARKS) A worker in the factory is supposed to wear safety boots with steel toes while 

operating the press. One day, her supervisor notices that she is wearing running shoes that do not 
have steel toes. 

Describe one obligation of the worker and one obligation of the supervisor in a case like this. Full 
sentences are not required.

17. (4 MARKS) One way of forming plastic or metal sheets is to use matched steel dies that come 
together with the plastic in-between to form the final shape. Such presses could be very 
dangerous; for example, they could crush a worker’s arm. You are to design a forming process that 
is as safe as possible.  

a)  Could the crush hazard be eliminated entirely? Show some evidence of structured creative 

thinking. 

b)  If the crush hazard is not eliminated, how could you guard against the hazard to protect workers?

18. (4 MARKS) Estimation Question: 

How many metric tonnes (1 tonne = 1000kg) of salt does the City of Toronto use on its roads 
annually? Estimate this amount using reasonable assumptions based on your personal knowledge and 
the information provided here. Salt has a density of ~ 2 tonnes/m3, and the city has an area of          
630 km2. You don’t have to get the exact answer, obviously, but you do have to compute a number, 
and show an appropriate method of making this estimation. You may earn a bonus mark if you can 
suggest a way of being sure that your answer is reasonable, without using any additional information.
