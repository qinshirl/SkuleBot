1.  A 3.0 m-wide steel plate is used to support a 
body of fresh water as shown. If the density 
of water is 1000 kg/m3, determine the support 
reactions at B and C. Neglect the weight of 
the steel plate. Show the results on a new 
sketch.

2.  3.0 m-wide gate ABC is supported by a pin at B and a 
point load at C. The gate has a mass of 300 kg between 
A and B. If the density of water is 1000 kg/m3, and the 
density of mud is 1800 kg/m3, determine the force that 
the gate exerts on the smooth stop at A.

3.  A 6.0 m-wide concrete gravity dam is held in place by its own 
weight. If the density of concrete is 2500 kg/m3, the density of 
water is 1000 kg/m3, and the density of silt is 1760 kg/m3, 
determine: 

i.)    the overturning moment; 
ii.)   the resisting moment in terms of d; and 
iii.) the distance d that will prevent the dam from overturning.
