1. The steel beam depicted below is supported by a frictionless surface at A and a fixed support at C. 
Member AB is loaded by a uniformly distributed force and is pinned to member BC at B.

(a) In the space provided draw the internal-force diagrams for the beam. Indicate the values at all points 
marked along the beam (viz. A, B, C, 1 and 2) and aimotate the shape of the diagrams.

(b) The cross-section of the beam is also represented. Determine if the beam material remains elastic at all 
points across the section and everywhere along the beam, given that the yield stress for steel is 350 MPa.

2. For the steel truss illustrated: (i) Determine the force in members AH, HM, CD, IJ and JN, and indicate 
if the members are in tension or compression. Take P = 150 kN and a = 2.5 m.

(ii) From a different loading condition, the force in member EQ (cross-sectional area 1,700 mm^, modulus 
of elasticity 200 GPa) is 580 kN in tension. Determine the axial stress in, and the elongation of the 
member.

3. The cross-section of a 3.0 m-wide (in the plane of the figure), fresh-water tank with a slanted bottom is 
presented. A rectangular door in the bottom of the tank, 1.6 m by 0.8 m (normal to the plane of the figure), 
is hinged at A and can be opened by the vertical cable under a tension P, as shown. Determine the 
minimum tension force in the cable required to open the door. The door is fabricated from 16 mm-thick 
steel plate with a mass density of 7,850 kg/m^.

4. The arm ADE of the boring machine is attached to a rigid support by pins at A and A ’ (not visible). DE 
is parallel to the x-axis. The arm is also supported by the hydraulic cylinder BD which has a ball-and- 
socket joint at each end. The applied loading consists of a force P = 6.2 kN and a couple C = 4.8 kNm, 
both acting at the boring tool E. Neglecting the weight of the members, determine the force in the cylinder 
BD (provide both the magnitude and the Cartesian vector expression).
