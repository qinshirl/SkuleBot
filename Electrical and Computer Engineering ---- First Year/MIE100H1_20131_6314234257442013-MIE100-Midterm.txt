Question 1 [35 marks total] 

The two sliders A (mA = 0.1 kg) and B (mB = 0.3 kg) move without friction in the 
horizontal  plane  circular  slot.  They  are  linked  together  by  a  string  of  zero  mass.  
Both masses are at rest when the force P is applied in the direction shown.  

a)  Draw  a  free  body  diagram  of  mass  A  in  the  position  shown.  Include  all 
forces, in the plane of motion, that act on A. Include a sketch of the relevant 
normal and tangential co-ordinates. [5 Marks] 

b)  Draw  a  free  body  diagram  of  mass  B  in  the  position  shown.  Include  all 
forces, in the plane of motion, that act on B; include a sketch of the relevant 
normal and tangential co-ordinates. What is the normal acceleration of B in 
the position shown? [10 Marks] 

c)  What is the tension in the string AB, in the position shown?  

[10 Marks] 

d)  What  is  the  total  acceleration  of  mass  B  in  the  position  shown?  Use  the 

normal and tangential co-ordinates from b) for your final answer.  
[10 Marks]

Question 2 [25 marks total] 

g = 9.81 m/s2 

y 

x 

A  very  small  sphere  of  mass  3  kg  is  carried  by  the  parallelogram  linkage,  where 
each side of the parallelogram has length 500 mm. The relaxed length of the spring 
is 400 mm. Ignore the mass of the link arms. At time t=0,  θ = 90o and the linkage 
is rotating in the clockwise direction such that the sphere has a speed of 4 m/s. 

a)  What is the potential energy of the spring at time t=0? [10 Marks] 

b)  What  will  be  the  direction  of  travel  of  the  sphere  when θ    gets  extremely 
close to 180o ? (Express your answers in terms of the given x-y coordinate 
system.) [5 Marks] 

c)  Find the speed of the sphere when θ gets extremely close to 180o.  

    [10 Marks]

B. [10 Marks] 

b)  What is the velocity of cylinder B at t=0 ? [10 Marks] 

c)  What is the acceleration of cylinder A at t=2 s and the acceleration of 

cylinder B at t=2 s ? [10 Marks] 

d)  Find the velocity of cylinder B at time t=2 s. [10 Marks]
