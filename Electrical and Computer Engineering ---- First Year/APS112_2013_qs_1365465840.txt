Questions 1 to 5 relate to a project “Building a wagon” such as in the picture and the Gantt chart shown. 
The Gantt chart is not completely finished or correct. 

1.  How many people (minimum) must be working at the 

same time for this Gantt chart to be correct? 

a.  1 
b.  2 
c.  3 
d.  4 

2.  Task #4, “Build Axles,” is NOT a predecessor of any task, which is an error. It should be a 

predecessor of task 5, “Mount axles.” When this relationship is put into the graph, how many 
extra hours will it push out the end of the project? 

a.  0 (There will be no change in the timing of the end of the project if this is done) 
b.  1 
c.  2 
d.  3 

3.  Task #5 has as its predecessor entry “6FS+4 hrs”. This means 

a.  Task #5 must be done within 4 hours of the end of task #6 
b.  Task #5 must start within 4 hours of the end of task #6 
c.  Task #5 must be done after a 4 hour wait from the end of task #6 
d.  No tasks can take place for 4 hours after the end of task #5 

4.  To allow for the paint to dry we would 

a.  Assign a resource called “drying time” and assign it a task “paint dry” 
b. 
c. 
d. 

Indicate a lag before any following task in hours 
Indicate a lag before any following task in elapsed hours 
Indicate a lag for the task of painting 

5.  Which of the following is FALSE: 

a.  The critical path has all the important tasks on it. 
b.  Milestones have no duration. 
c.  Gateways are decision points in the project where a project could be cancelled. 
d.  An “Activity on the arrow” Pert chart sometimes requires dummy tasks.

6.  Which is NOT an acceptable outcome of the solution selection stage? 

a.  No solution available. Cancel project. 
b.  One recommended solution. Proceed with final design.

primary function? 

a.  Get information from damaged hard drives 
b.  Filter noise from signals 
c.  Will follow HTML 5 standards 
d.  Mine information 

9.  The list first generated in a functional decomposition of a bagel slicer would look like: 

a.  Secure bagel, separate bagel length-wise, release bagel 
b.  Knives, chop saws, water jet cutters, laser cutters 
c.  Safe, easy to clean, inexpensive 
d.  Brainstorming, analogy, morph chart

teenagers from texting while driving. From a Design for 
Safety perspective this is an attempt to reduce: 

a. 
Ignorance 
b.  Law suits 
c.  Hazards 
d.  Risks 

11. Which safer design principle should you first attempt?

Written Answer (marks per question as indicated on question; 14 marks total) 

Write answers into the spaces provided on the question paper. 

Client Statement #1 (Questions 17-22) 
I use a motorized wheelchair (see figure 1) to get from my car 
to the baseball diamond to watch my daughter’s baseball 
games. Some of the parks where the games are played do not 
have paved access from the street to the diamonds. Often I 
have to try to cross grass and sometimes mud using my 
wheelchair to get to the baseball diamond. More than once I 
have gotten stuck in a dip in the grass or in some mud. Once I 
even tipped over. I need you to redesign my wheelchair to increase its motor to 300 horsepower 
to keep me from getting stuck. The motor must be mounted on the bottom of the chair to keep the 
center of mass low and keep me from tipping over. The structure of the chair will need to be 
strengthened to handle the additional weight of the motor and the torque it will apply when 
running. Titanium is stronger than steel and so you can use less of it so it will save money. Please 
use tricks like this to keep costs low. Try to keep the new chair from costing more than my 
existing chair. I want mud flaps to keep me clean if I go through a puddle, and a drink holder.  

17. (2 mark) The functional basis for this project is: 

18. (2 marks) What is the purpose of defining the functional basis at the start of a project? 

19. (2 mark) Give one stakeholder and state their interest. 

20. (3 marks) Give one primary function, one objective and one constraint for the project. 

Primary Function:  

Objective:  

Constraint:
