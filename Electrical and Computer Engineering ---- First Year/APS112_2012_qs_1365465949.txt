“Activity on the Arrow”. 

b.  Activity on the Arrow representations sometimes require dummy tasks to 

properly represent the precedence of one task by another.

Questions 9 – 11 refer to Client Statement #1. 

Client Statement #1 
Portatech Diversions is seeking an interactive projection system that allows users to project touch 
screens on any surface and interact with the projection as they would with the original device. 
This would allow users to input more easily on smart phones, iPhones and other hand-held 
devices with small screens that limit the size of buttons. The projection, which would have to be 
visible outdoors in full sunlight, will allow users to dial phone numbers, play games, or text 
messages (to name a few examples). [1]

http://www.innovationnewsdaily.com/643-touch-and-tap-new-device-lets-users-use-anything-as-
touchscreen.html. [Accessed 6 February 2012]. 

9.  The fundamental functionality for the above problem would be: 

a.  Deposit energy. 
b.  Stabilize information.

d.  Separate mass. 
e.  Transform information. 

10. Which of the following statements about stakeholders and their interests is best? 

a.  Manufacturers – interest is improving their smart phones. 
b.  Users – interest is in bigger buttons on their hand-held devices. 
c.  Government agencies – interest is in protecting intellectual property. 
d.  Non-governmental agencies – interest is using new technology to project 

information. 

e.  Eye doctors – interest is in preventing harm caused by bright projections. 

11. An appropriate constraint for the above problem would be: 

a.  Projected buttons shall be 2 cm by 2 cm in size. 
b.  Projections shall be completely visible in direct sunlight. 
c.  Projections shall be safe and non-toxic. 
d.  Projection brightness shall be at least 1300 lumens. 
e.  Projection capability shall be applicable to all smart phone designs. 

12. Your team of Archie, Betty and Jughead has completed the PR/PMP, but not without 

conflict. Betty and Jughead have stopped talking to each other and you decide you had 
better mediate the conflict before you all fail your CDS. The first step you should take is: 

a.  Separate individuals from issues. 
b.  Move from the storming stage to the norming stage. 
c.  Develop criteria for selecting an option. 
d.  Create list of pro’s and con’s to continuing as a team.

13. You are searching for a highly specialized diamond tipped cutter for cutting granite 

countertops. It is not the type of thing that could be found at the local hardware store. You 
should: 

a.  Use an industrial database like Thomas Register or Global Spec. 
b.  Find a Wikipedia article on cutting wheels.  
c.  Do a Google search for “diamond tip cutters” 
d.  Review the patent literature to learn about cutters.  
e.  Start by brainstorming new designs for cutters before doing any homework. 

14. Although the belt sander-based paper folder demonstrated in lecture did work, it 

ultimately was a poor design compared to a buckle folder. In attempting to produce an 
optimum design for a machine like this, the design engineer should: 

a.  Attempt to mimic manual methods as a starting point for the design. 
b.  Not review the prior art to avoid restricting creativity. 
c.  Prototype a machine using simple components like Meccano or Lego. 
d.  Strive for simplicity in the conceptual design. 
e.  Strive for simplicity in the final implementation of the design.  

15. You are trying to make a safe saw for cutting plaster casts used in a hospital when people 
break their bones. The best solution for dealing with the hazard of cutting the underlying 
skin is: 

a.  Design a guard that fits between the cast and skin to keep the blade from touching 

the skin.  

b.  Train the doctors to set the blade depth to just less than the thickness of the 

plaster. 

c.  Give the patient painkillers just in case the saw cuts them.  
d.  Switch from plaster to fiberglass, which can be cut with shears. 
e.  Design a saw that vibrates and cuts plaster but not skin.  

16. Design by analogy (Synectics) is a useful technique for deriving creative solutions. In 

designing a new helicopter blade, it would be reasonable for an experienced designer to:

b.  Look at other stiff, light structures like snowboards. 
c.  Survey the patent literature for the latest developments in helicopter blade 

technology.

17. In choosing the best conceptual design solution, which of the following is FALSE? 

a.  The advantage of a Pugh Selection method is that it allows for a direct comparison 

between alternatives. 

b.  The advantage of a weighted decision matrix is that it provides a quantitative 

comparison between alternatives.  

c.  It is not a good idea to leave the decision to the most technically competent 

member of the design group.  

d.  The conceptual designs should be presented to the client, who should choose one 

that meets his/her needs the best.  

e.  Formal decision making tools are good because they can compensate for 

individual bias.  

18. Which is an appropriate introduction to the functions section of your PR/PMP? 

a.  Functions are what a design shall do or else the design fails.  
b.  Functions are what define the design space of a project. They are classified as 

primary, secondary and unintended. 

c.  See the glossary in Appendix T for the definition of a function. 
d.  In order to solve your problem our solution will need to do the following. 
e.  The fundamental function of your required design is to increase the efficiency of 

mass flow through your office space. In the following sections this flow of mass is 
broken down into several basic functions. 

Written Answer (marks per question as indicated on question; 16 marks total) 

Written questions must be answered in the spaces provided on the question paper. 

19. (3 MARKS) [This question pertains to the Gantt chart in Figure 1 on page 3] 

Assuming that the friend helps and that the original Gantt chart has the proper start times 
for all tasks, the lag time that was added before the “Done” milestone to allow the glue to 
dry has forced the time of the milestone to be on the Monday. In fact, for one day of 
drying, the project is done on the Saturday. How can we adjust the duration (or time) 
designation of the lag so it reflects the true glue drying time?

metres from the existing terminal and 10,000 passengers are expected to move between the two 
terminals each day. You are to design a system for moving people between the two terminals at 
minimum capital (initial) cost and minimal operating cost. All options are open for consideration.  

20. (5 MARKS) Give one intended function, one unintended and undesirable function, two 

objectives and one constraint for this problem.

22. (5 MARKS) Use a functional decomposition approach to find a suitable conceptual 
design for the people mover. Full marks will be given only for a reasonably simple, 
feasible solution, and provided that a good functional decomposition has been used.  You 
may assume that you already have a properly ranked list of objectives, and a complete list 
of functions and constraints.  You are to focus on the creative process of finding an actual 
solution and the method needed to find the best one.
