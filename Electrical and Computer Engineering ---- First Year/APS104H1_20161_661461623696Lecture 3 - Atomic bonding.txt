Atomic and ionic radii 

Atomic Radii 

Atomic radius is half the 
distance between the nuclei 
of two identical atoms when 
they are bonded together. 

A comparison of atomic and ionic sizes 

In general all cations are 
smaller than their parent atoms. 

In general all anions are larger 
than their parent atoms. 

Periodic trend in atomic radii 

Because it is impossible to measure the sizes of both metallic and 
nonmetallic elements using any one method, chemists have developed 
a self-consistent way of calculating atomic radii using the quantum 
mechanical functions. These values provide a way to compare the 
intrinsic sizes of all elements. 

decreasing 

Because in a row, 
the number of shell 
is constant, but the 
numbers of protons 
is increasing from 
left to right ! the 
effective nuclear 
charge (Zeff) 
increases and the 
outer most electrons 
are more attracted to 
the nucleus ! 
smaller atomic radii 

Because the 
number of shell 
are increasing

forces 

bond formation 

If the atoms are too far apart, attraction are weak and no bonding 
occurs. 
If the atoms are too close, strong repulsions occur.  
When atoms are optimally separated, net force is zero, and the 
energy is at a minimum ! that’s when bond forms. 

Generic bonding curve 

•  At r0, the ions are more stable (have a lower potential energy) than they are at an 
infinite internuclear distance. When oppositely charged ions are brought together 
from r = ∞ to r = r0, the energy of the system is lowered (energy is released). 

Primary interatomic bonding 
(between atoms) 

Primary interatomic bonds 

1 - Ionic bonds – between metals and non-metals – the 
metal gives up its valence electron (cation) & the non-metal 
receives the electron (anion) – columbic interaction 
between positive and negative ions 

Ionic bonds are non-directional – anions and cations pack 
closely together in mineral structures.  

 
Ionic bonds 

Properties (nature of ionic bonding in solids): 
-   Exchange of electron between the metal and non-metal 
-  Bonding energy high ! high melting T 
-  Hard 
-  Brittle 
-  Electrically and thermally insulative (no free electrons)

Ionic bonds 

Usually between metals from column IA and IIA and non metals from VIA and VIIA 
Examples: KCl, LiCl, LiBr, NaBr, BaS, CaO, CaF2, Na2S,CsF, MgS, …

Primary interatomic bonds 

2 - Covalent bonds – due to sharing of valence 
electrons (usually between non metals) 

Cl2, H2, F2, N2 
CH4, H2O, HNO3 
Diamond 
SiC 
Most polymers (along carbon 
chains) 

These materials can be very hard (like diamond) 
and can have very high melting T 
They can also be weak and have low melting T 

Polar covalent bonds: electronegativity 

ELECTRONEGATIVITY: The ability of an atom in a molecule to attract 
the shared electrons in a covalent bond. 

Electropositive elements: 
Readily give up electrons 
to become + ions.	  

Electronegative elements: 
Readily acquire electrons 
to become - ions.	  

Cl2	  

NaCl	  

Primary interatomic bonds 

3 - Metallic bonds – consists of metal cores (net 
positive charge) in a sea of free electrons – this 
bond is non-directional 

Properties (nature of metallic bonding 
in solids): 
-  Electrically and thermally conductive 

(because of free electrons) 

-  They exists between all metals in the 

P-table 

-  Ductile (can deform significantly 

before fracturing (but ionic bonds are 
brittle)) 

Summary: 
Primary interatomic bonding 
(between atoms) 

Ionic (electrostatic between cation & anion) 
1. 
2.  Covalent (electron sharing, stable electronic 

structure) 

3.  Metallic (positively charged ions, shielded 

from each other, kept together by a sea of e-) 

Secondary bonding 
(between molecules) 

Secondary bonding 

1.  Van der Waals bonds: Fluctuating induced dipole 

bonds – an electrically symmetric molecule (non-polar) 
may loose its symmetry instantaneously and becomes 
dipole and induces this to its neighbor – then there will 
be attraction between these molecules (like noble 
gases, Cl2, H2) 
 Melting T and boiling T are very low; the weakest type of 

bonding 

Secondary bonding 

2. Polar molecules – dipole bonds – between molecules 
that are polar (have negative and positive poles due to 
electronegativity difference) 
Polar molecules consist of atoms with different 
electronegativity like HCl, H2S, SO2

Secondary bonding 

3. Hydrogen bonding– between molecules in which 
hydrogen is bonded with F, O, or N (H – F) (H – O) (H – N) 
(Example: HF, H2O, NH3) 
Hydrogen is highly positively charged in these molecules 
and it can accept an electron pair from the negative end of 
an adjacent molecule ! each proton is like a bridge 
between two negatively charged atoms. 

  
Summary: 
Secondary bonding 
(between molecules) 

1.  Van der Waals bonds (Fluctuating 

induced dipole bonds) (weakest) 

2.  Dipole bonds (between polar molecules) 

(intermediate) 

3.  Hydrogen bonds (strongest)

Strength of the bonds 

• 

If you make covalent solids (atoms with covalent bonds 
between them, like diamond, SiO2); they form a “solid 
network” and they have the highest melting point. 

•  After that, we have ionic solids, and then metallic solids. 
Sometimes metallic solids has higher melting point, it is 
case by case. 

•  Then we have secondary bonding; hydrogen bonding is 

the highest, then dipole bonding (between polar 
molecules), and then van der Waals bonds (between non 
polar molecules). They all make molecular solids. 

•  Network solids > “ionic solids > metallic solids” > 

“hydrogen bonds > dipole > van der Waals” 

Case by case 

Molecular solids

molecular) each of the following forms on solidification:

B.  ionic 

C.  metallic 

D.  network

The general order of increasing strength of interactions in a solid is molecular 
solids < ionic solids ≈ metallic solids < network solids.
