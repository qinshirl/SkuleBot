               100% 

Text and notes:  
Engineering Mechanics: Statics, 13th Edition in SI units, R.C. Hibbeler, Pearson Prentice-Hall, 2013, and 
the  associated  study  pack.  Complementary  notes,  dated  July,  2010,  on  three  topics  in  strength  of 
materials are shrunk-wrapped  with the texts.  Complementary  notes  are also available as  pdf file on the 
Portal/Blackboard.  Students taking MIE100S will purchase both the statics and dynamics text, along with 
the shrunk-wrapped notes. 

Quizzes,  test  and  exam  will  be  "closed-book"  i.e.,  no  aids  allowed  except  for  a  non-programmable 
calculator. 
Permissible non-programmable calculators are: Casio FX991, Sharp EL520 (Trailing letters after a model 
number are irrelevant.) In class you may use only one of the three calculators listed. 

For each of the teaching sections  of CIV 100F, the  40% term work component  will be  normalized to  a 
class average of 28/40 (i.e., 70%).  This may require either raising or lowering the actual marks obtained. 

Portal/Blackboard (http://portal.utoronto.ca) is going to be used for the posting of marks.  
Plagiarism is an academic offence. Sanctions range from a zero for the work to an expulsion from 
the university and a notation on the transcript. 
Petitions for missing exams or remarks are handled by first year office. 

Eating,  drinking,  any  kind  of  disruptive  behaviour  (talking,  the  use  of  laptop,  mobile  phone  etc.) 
are not permitted in lectures and tutorials. 

Some Notes on Tutorials: 

1.  Attendance may be taken at tutorials. 

2.  The tutorial problem sheets will be handed out at the beginning of a tutorial period.  The pages of the 
completed  problem  set,  including  the  original  problem  sheet  as  the  last  page,  MUST  be  stapled 
together - problem sets fastened with paper clips or folds will not be accepted.  

3.  Problem sets must be done neatly in pencil on one side only of the engineering problem paper.  (Do 
not  write  on  the  back  of  the  pages.)    Pads  of  this  paper  are  sold  in  the  Eng.  Society  Store,  in  the 
basement of the Sandford Fleming Bldg.  A straight edge and eraser are required for drawings. 

4.  The  completed  problem  set  is  to  be  submitted  before  the  beginning  of  the  Tuesday  lecture.  Late 

submission will not be accepted. 

5.  A  problem  set  will  be  marked  (2  =  excellent,  0  =  unsatisfactory)  and  returned  at  the  next  tutorial 

period. 

6.  A  problem  set  with  a  mark  of  0  can  be  resubmitted  again  for  remarking  before  the  beginning  of  the 

next lecture.
