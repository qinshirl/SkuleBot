4. Let f (x) = a ln(bx) where a is a positive constant and b is a negative constant. Which of the following statements are
guaranteed to be true? [2 marks]

You can fill in more than one option for this question (unfilled

⃝ The domain of f (x) is (0, ∞).

The graph of f (x) has a vertical asymptote.

f −1(0) = b−1.

⃝ f ′(x) =

a
bx

.

f (x) is strictly decreasing on its domain.

• Since b is negative, the domain of f is (−∞, 0) for ln(bx) to be defined. The first choice is false.

• The second choice is true since f has a vertical asymptote at x = 0.

• Since f (b−1) = a ln 1 = 0 It follows that f −1(0) = b−1. The third choice is true.

• Since f ′(x) = a

x , the fourth choice is false.

• Since f ′(x) < 0 on its domain, we can conclude that f is strictly decreasing on its domain. Alternatively, we can

reach the same conclusion from sketching the graph of f . Therefore, the fifth choice is true.

5. Let f (x) be a strictly decreasing, differentiable function on (−∞, ∞). Suppose that f (−3) = 2, and f (2) = −3. Which
of the following statements are guaranteed to be true? [2 marks]

You can fill in more than one option for this question (unfilled

filled ).

⃝ f (x) = −x − 1.

lim
x→2

f (x) = −3.

⃝ lim
x→∞

f (x) → −∞.

There exists a value of x such that f (x) = 0.

f ′(2) ≤ 0.

• The first choice is false. There are many functions with f (−3) = 2 and f (2) = −3.

• The second choice is true. All differentiable functions are also continuous.

• The third choice is false. Although f is decreasing, it may approach a finite limit as x → ∞, if the graph of f has

a horizontal asymptote.

• The fourth choice is true. Since f is continuous, this is guaranteed from the intermediate value theorem.

• The fifth choice is true. If f is strictly decreasing on its domain, then f ′(x) ≤ 0 on its domain.

Multiple Choice: No justification is required. Only your final answer will be graded.

6. The cross-sectional dimensions of a type of wooden board called a “2x4” are nominally 2 inches by 4 inches (hence the
name). However, the actual dimensions of a 2x4 may be as small as 1.5 inches by 3.5 inches in practice. Assume that the
dimensions are never larger than 2 inches by 4 inches.

Let E be the error of the the cross sectional area A of a 2x4. Which of the following statements are true? [2 marks]

You can fill in more than one option for this question (unfilled

filled ).

5.25 (in)2 ≤ A ≤ 8 (in)2

8 − A ≤ 2.75

⃝ |A − 8| = 2.75

⃝ E = |A − 2.75|.

E = |8 − A|.

−2.75 ≤ E ≤ 2.75

From the question, we are given that the area A of a board satisfies 5.25 ≤ A ≤ 8 in2. Therefore, 8 − A ≤ 2.75. We are
not guaranteed that |A − 8| = 2.75.

If E is the error in the area, the error is E = |8 − A| since the true area of a board should be 8 in2. Since 0 ≤ 8 − A ≤ 2.75
from the problem, we also have 0 ≤ E ≤ 2.75. This guarantees that the last choice is also satisfied as the error never
exceeds -2.75 or 2.75.

7. Let r(x) and s(x) be functions defined on the interval [1, 5] such that 1 ≤ r(x) ≤ 3 and x ≤ s(x) ≤ 2x. Which of the

values below are guaranteed to be upper bounds for

8. A population of deer was released on an uninhabited island in Northern Ontario in an effort to establish a permanent
population of deer on the island. Over time, the population of deer increased. The table below summarizes the population

Let P (t) give the population of deer on the island at time t measured in years after 2020.

(a) In one sentence, give a practical interpretation of P (50) in terms of year and population of deer. [1 mark]

P (50) is the number of deer on the island in 2070.

(b) In one sentence, give a practical interpretation of P −1(50) in terms of year and population of deer. [1 mark]

P −1(50) is the number of years needed for the population to grow to 50 deer.

(c) Use the table above to estimate (P −1)′(25). Show your reasoning. [1 mark]

Recall that the derivative of the inverse (P −1)′ and P ′ are related by:

Since P −1(25) = 3, we need to approximate P ′(3). From the table, we see that

(P −1)′(25) =

1
P ′(P −1(25))

.

Therefore, we can approximate

P ′(3) ≈ P (4) − P (3) = 4.

(P −1)′(25) ≈

4

.

(d) Using your answer from part (c), give a practical interpretation of (P −1)′(25) in terms of year and population of deer.
[1 mark]

When the deer population has 25 deer, it takes about 1/4 years (or 3 months) for the population to grow by one deer.

9. Water leaking onto your bedroom floor creates a circular pool with an area that increases at the rate of 3 square
centimetres per minute. How fast is the radius of the pool increasing when the radius is 10 centimetres? Be sure that
you clearly define any variables (including units) that you introduce, and that you clearly identify what you are trying to
solve for using mathematical notation. [3 marks]

Let r be the radius of the pool in cm. Its area A is A = πr2 since it is circular.

By the chain rule, we conclude that

10. Provide a careful argument using the Squeeze Theorem to evaluate lim
x→∞

e− sin x
x

. [4 marks]

To use the Squeeze Theorem to evaluate the limit lim
x→a

f (x), we must identify two functions, g(x) and h(x) such that

g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x) in some interval around the point a, though not necessarily at a itself. Then, we must show that
lim
x→a

f (x) is “squeezed” between f (x) and g(x), and lim
x→a

h(x) = lim
x→a

g(x) = lim
x→a

g(x) = lim
x→a

f (x).

In this case, we have f (x) =

, and a → ∞. First, we identify appropriate bounding functions for f (x). Consider:

h(x), such that lim
x→a
e− sin(x)
x

Then, for x → +∞ x > 0, so

−1 ≤ − sin(x) ≤ 1 =⇒

≤ e− sin(x) ≤ e

Taking g(x) =

that lim
x→a

g(x) = lim
x→a

h(x) = 0, and g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x) for x → ∞, we can conclude by the Squeeze Theorem

11. Show that there exists at least one solution x ∈ (0, ∞) to the equation

x186 = x

(cid:112)

x2 + cos2 x + 32

[4 marks]

This question tests the use of the Intermediate Value Theorem. First, we re-arrange the equation and define a function
such that

f (x) = x186 − x(cid:112)x2 + cos2(x) − 32

and note that f (x) is a continuous function over x ∈ ℜ. Then we can reduce the problem to showing that f (x) = 0 at
least once in its domain.

To do this, we search for locations x = a such that f (a) < 0 and x = b such that f (b) > 0. Once we have determined
these points, we can use the IVT to conclude that there must exist some x = c ∈ [a, b] such that f (c) = 0, as desired.

First, we notice that f (0) = −32 < 0, so we choose a = 0. Then, we notice that x186 very quickly dominates the behaviour
of the function for x > 1. In fact, we can show that

x186 − x(cid:112)x2 + cos2(x) − 32 → ∞

lim
x→∞

Therefore, we can select some b ≫ 1 such that f (b) > 0, and conclude by IVT that there must be at least one location
x = c where f (c) = 0, since f (x) is continuous over the whole real line.

F (0) = −9.8m

where m is the mass of the object, and R is the radius of the earth.

(a) Use a linear approximation to estimate F (h) near sea level. [3 marks]

Using the standard form for linear approximation, we seek an expression of the form

L(h) =

dF
dh

|x=0(h − 0) + F (0)

Substituting the expressions above, we obtain:

L(h) =

h − 9.8m

L(h) =

h − 9.8m

Therefore, near sea level, F (h) ≈ 19.6

R h − 9.8m.

(b) Does your answer from part (a) give an underestimation or overestimation of the actual value of F (h) near sea level?

[3 marks]

Indicate your final answer by filling in exactly one circle below (unfilled

filled ).

⃝ Underestimate.

Overestimate.

To determine whether the linear approximation at h = 0 will be an overestimate or an underestimate, we consider the
concavity of F (h) at this point. Taking the derivative of dF

dh we have

and evaluating at h = 0, we see that the second derivative is negative, therefore the function F (h) is concave down, and
the linear approximation is an overestimate of the value of the function in the region near h = 0.
