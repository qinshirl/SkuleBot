1. The 7.5  m-long timber floor beam,  having a square cross-section,  is  to  be designed to  carry the  loads 
shown. Because only  5 m-long timbers are available, the beam  is  to  be fabricated from  two pieces 
connected together by a nailed joint, D.  You are required to: 
(a) In the  space provided, draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam  indicating the 
values at points A, B, and C,  and any potential  local maxima and  minima; 
(b) If wood has a strength of30 MPa,  in  both tension and compression, determine the required size, a,  for 
the beam such that it can  safely carry the floor loads. The load factor for timber in  bending is  l .67; and 
( c) Determine the distance b for the  most advantageous position of the joint D, knowing that nailed joints 
are strong in shear but weak in  bending.

2.  Determine the tension  in  the cable at B when the  180 N  force  is  applied to  the pedal at E.  Also, calculate 
the reaction force components at the pins at A and D.  If the cable at B has a diameter of 7 .0 mm and the 
yield stress of the cable material  is  70  MPa, determine the actual  load (safety) factor for the cable.  In  your 
opinion,  is this a  'safe' design? In all  your calculations, neglect friction  and the mass of the components.

3. The fresh  water channel  illustrated can be emptied by opening the 6,300 kg solid gate ABC (represented 
in  cross-section). The gate is  5  m wide (into the paper), is  pinned at A,  rests against the vertical wall at B 
and can be operated by pulling on  the cable attached to  it  at C.  Determine the  minimum magnitude of the 
force,  F, required to open the gate.

4. Determine the force  in  members BC,  CJ,  DF, FH, Hf and state if the  members are  in  tension or 
compression. Members CJ,  DF and FH are  to  be fabricated  using the same circular hollow section having 
an external diameter of 30  mm  and a yield  stress of 150 MPa.  Knowing that the  load factor for  members in 
axial  tension  is  1.5, determine the minimum  wall  thickness of the cross-section,/, such that the three 
members are safe.  The wall  thickness can be selected in  0.5  mm  increments. Also,  what is  the elongation 
of member DF? The modulus of elasticity for the material  is  69,000 M Pa.

5.  The frame  shown is  supported by a ball-and-socket joint at A  and a pin at C.  (The pin  is  similar to  a 
ball~and-socket joint that was  modified to  allow translation  in  the x-direction.) The strut EF has a ball-and 
socket joint at each end. The cable EBD  runs over a small  frictionless pulley at B and carries a 2,700 N 
weight at D. Neglecting the weight of the members, determine the force exerted by member EF on  the 
frame at F  and the magnitude of the total  reaction at  C.
