LONG ANSWER PART

9. Let f (x) = sin(x3).

(12 marks)

In the following we will consider its Taylor Polynomial and its Taylor Series. You can assume that

the Taylor Series converges, no need to prove it.

(a) (4 marks) What is the Taylor polynomial of degree 9 centred at 0 for f (x)? Justify your

answer.

p9(x) =

(b) (4 marks) Approximate the integral

using your answer from (a). Justify your answer.

10. When you eat something, the food goes into your stomach and then your body

(12 marks)

starts absorbing it. We will attempt to model the absorption of food in your stomach.

Food is absorbed from the surface, so

Rate of change of the volume of food in the stomach is proportional to the food’s surface area.

Let’s assume that, in the stomach, the food has the shape of a ball (called the bolus) of radius r(t).

(a) (5 marks) A sphere of radius r has volume 4

3 πr3 and surface area 4πr2.

Obtain a diﬀerential equation for r(t). Use only positive constants and justify all your steps

and deﬁne all the constants and variables you use.

(b) (3 marks) How is the radius of the ball of food decreasing? Select all the true statements.

The radius of the ball of food decreases faster near the beginning than towards the end of

digestion.

The radius of the ball of food decreases faster towards the end than near the beginning of

digestion.

The radius of the ball of food decreases at the same rate both near the beginning and

towards the end of digestion.

After making a selection, justify your answer.

(c) (4 marks) Sketch the graph of r(t). Justify your sketch.

11. It’s 1905 and everyone believes that kinetic energy is given by the formula

(13 marks)

KC(s) =

m s2.

Here, m is the mass of the particle at rest and s is the speed of the particle.

Albert Einstein just published his paper on Special Relativity. In it he claimed that kinetic energy

is actually given by the formula

where c is the speed of light and s is still the speed of the particle.

KR(s) = mc2

The scientiﬁc community is very skeptical; after all the new formula KR(s) looks completely diﬀerent
from the classical one KC(s).

Your job is to ﬁnd out how these two formulas are related.

(a) (7 marks) Consider the function f (x) =

p1(x) centred at a = 0.

(c) (2 marks) You just approximated KR(s). Compare this approximation to the formula for

KC(s). What do you observe?
