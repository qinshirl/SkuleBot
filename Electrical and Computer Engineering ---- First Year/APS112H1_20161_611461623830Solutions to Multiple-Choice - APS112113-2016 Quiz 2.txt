B

For question #14, B is the correct answer. However, students who answered "D" also
received a mark because the glossary in the 2015-2016 textbook contained an incorrect
formula.  Students who used that incorrect formula would've came up with the answer in D.
Students who attended the lecture about this would've known about the error in the
textbook because it was discussed in lecture and discussed online.
The textbook error was flagged for correction but the new correct version isn't yet published.
