1. A worker having a mass of 80 kg supports himself in the boatswain’s chair by means of the cable and 
pulley system shown. If the seat has a mass of 7 kg, determine the tension force, T, which the worker must 
exert with his hands on the cable at A in order that he is in equilibrium. What force, R, does the worker 
exert on the chair? Neglect the mass of the cable and pulleys.

3. The plate shown is supported by hinges at A and B, and by the cable CE. The axes of the two hinges are 
aligned along the x-axis and the hinge at A is modified so that it can slide freely in the direction of the x-
axis. Determine the magnitude and indicate the direction of the reaction force components at the hinges 
and the magnitude of the force in the cable. Neglect the mass of the plate.
