16. Consider a log of wood given in the figure below with length 10 metres. The cross-section x metres from the leftmost 
point of the log is a circle with radius r{x) = 2 + 0.1(.t — 5)^ metres, where x S [0,10]. There is moss growing on the 
entire surface of the log except on the shaded portions at the endpoints. You would like to approximate the mass of moss 
growing on the log.

Suppose that the density of the moss growth, x metres from the leftmost point of the log, is given by p{x) = 100(5.t -t- 3) 
grams per squared metre, for x S [0,10]. That is, the more you move to the right on the log, the more dense the moss 
growth is.

Write a Riemann sum approximation, with n subintervals, modelling the mass of moss growing on the log. Make sure to 
state your assumptions and explain all your steps. You are encouraged to annotate the figure to support your explanation.
