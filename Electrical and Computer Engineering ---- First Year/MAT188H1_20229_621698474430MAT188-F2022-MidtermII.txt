Part A

1. (6 points) Fill in the circle for all statements that must be true. You don’t need to
include your work or reasoning. Some questions may have more than one correct answer.
You may get a negative mark if you choose an incorrect option.

⃝ S = {(x, y) ∈ R2 | xy = 0}, V = R2

⃝ S is the unit cube, V = R3

⃝ S is a plane through origin in R3, V = R3

⃝ S = {(x, y) ∈ R2 | x2 + y2 < 1}, V = R2

⃝ S is the kernel of a linear transformation T : R5 → R6, V = R5

⃝ S is the image of a linear transformation T : R5 → R6, V = R5

(b) Assume the given statement and choose all the phrases that are true. “A⃗x = ⃗0 has

a unique solution, where A is an n × p matrix”

⃝ The linear transformation T defined by T (⃗x) = A⃗x is injective.

⃝ Columns of A span Rp.

⃝ A⃗x = ⃗b has a solution for every ⃗b in Rp.

⃝ There is at least one redundant vector among columns of A.

⃝ The linear transformation T defined by T (⃗x) = A⃗x is surjective.

⃝ If A⃗x = ⃗b is consistent then it has a unique solution.

⃝ Columns of A are linearly independent.

box, and provide a short and complete justification for your claim in the larger box. If
you think a statement is true explain why it must be true. If you think a statement is
false, give a counterexample.

Part C

6. Becoming more and more interested with lower-dimensional beings, Cordylia has dis-
covered a way to build a machine which can transport part of herself down to lower
dimensional space without causing irreparable damage to herself. She wishes to perform
a test of her machine.
Cordylia’s sensors have discovered beings which exist in the subspace V of R6 defined
by the following equations:

x + y + z + u + v + w = 0

x + z + v = 0

y + u + w = 0

matrix A for the projection map to the subspace V . Cordilya knows that there
exists an invertible matrix S such that A = S−1BS. Without computing it fully,
give an expression for the matrix S.
