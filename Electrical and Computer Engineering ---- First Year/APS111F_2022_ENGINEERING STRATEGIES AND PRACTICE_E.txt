Case Study #1-Team Case Study

Case study U1 is to be used for ONLY for the Teams Multiple Choice questions. DO 
NOT use this case study for the Long Answer questions.

The night before the PR was due, three members of a five-member team (Sam, Alex, and Taylor) were 
working on their team's document. Sam was concerned that they would not finish on time as Lesley had 
not completed his section, and the team could not get a hold of him. Kim showed up online at 10PM to 
ask the team how they were doing, as she was done her part two days in advance. After hearing that 
Lesley had not completed his part, Kim - the team's project manager - reassigned Lesley's work to Alex. 
Alex was not happy about this and felt that the situation was unfair as he had not yet completed his 
part.

Case Study #2 - Multiple Choice: Better Chip Bag

Case study U2 is to be used for ONLY for the Multiple Choice questions. DO NOT use 
this case study for the Long Answer questions.

Around the world people eat chips, also called crisps, that are sold in plastic bags (see figure 1). There 
are numerous types of chips and flavors. Some of the most popular are potato chips, corn chips, and 

snacks (e.g., Popchips). They also come in a range of flavors from the iconic Canadian favorite, ketchup 
flavored, to popular spicy or cheese flavors. Often the chips are salty and may have a flavoring powder 
applied to the surface. According to Research and Markets [1], the global potato chip industry alone is 
expected to reach $39 Billion (US) by 2027, with the market made up of both major global players like 
Kellogg's and Kraft Foods, as well smaller regional producers.

The ubiquitous bags not only keep the chips crisp and fresh they also keep the powdered coating and 
aroma contained. The bags are also sometimes used as food serving dishes by street food vendors [2].

Chip bags (technically called sacks) are often made of plastic, foil and paper laminated together. This 
means that many of the sacks cannot be recycled and do not biodegrade [3]. Some municipalities are 
now accepting thermoplastic flexible film sacks for recycling, but most end up as garbage [4]. The plastic 
in these bags is typically biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), which is moisture-resistant to keep the 
chips at a desirable crispiness even in very humid conditions [5]. In addition to serving as packaging for 
the chips, the bag also advertises the contents. In a very competitive market, with hundreds of different 
choices, the bag differentiates the brand [6].

There have been attempts to create biodegradable chip sacks, most notably the introduction of a new 
sack for SunChips by their parent company PepsiCo®. This sack, however, has been largely criticized for 
being nosier than traditional packaging [7]. The Wallstreet Journal reports that PepsiCo® acknowledged 
the problem: "Realizing there is no escaping the noise, Frito-Lay featured it in some of its marketing. In 
stores, the company attached signs to shelves that read: 'Yes, the bag is loud, that's what change sounds 
like.'" Unfortunately, such messaging cannot totally mitigate the negative consequences of the bag's 
noise problem. [8]

The client for this project. Big Smoke Chip Company in Toronto Ontario, has considered all the issues 
discussed above and is now looking for a new design for a chip bag. The new solution:

•  Should maintain the crispiness of the chips, in conditions up to 100% relative humidity (i.e., even 

if the outside of the bag gets wet).

•  Must be biodegradable: meets ISO 17088:2021 (if the solution is a plastic) or the equivalent.

•  Should be as or less noisy relative to current chip bags.

•  Dry air is added to the package during the filling process to ensure the chips do not get crushed 
during transport. However, this can cause the sack to puff up considerably in low pressure 
environments such as on airplanes. This can make the package difficult to open. A new solution 
should be as easy to open as current sack and should not burst in typical low pressure 
environments (e.g., on aircraft, or in La Paz, Bolivia).

•  The package must not lose its integrity at low or high temperatures. It should not become brittle 

or weak between -50 C and +50 C.

•  The package material must seal effectively, handle shipping and transport in bags filled with 

other groceries without crushing the chips or breaking open.

•  Must meet ISO 7965-2:1993 for drop testing for sacks made from thermoplastic flexible film. A 

new solution made of a different material should also pass this testing to be competitive with 
current packaging.

• 

Ideally the package could be used as a serving dish for the chips with toppings [2].

•  Should be able to be printed with a wide range of vivid, eye-catching graphics and, at a 
minimum, must be able to present required information (e.g., ingredients list) readably.

Case Study #3 - Long Answer: Wintertime wheelchair wheel cleaner

Case study #3 is to be used for ONLY for the Long Answer questions. DO NOT use this 
case study for the Multipie Choice questions.

Mingmei Li is an Industrial Engineer and health care efficiency consultant 
working with multiple hospitals in downtown Toronto. On any given 
workday she is moving from one hospital to another, usually on 
University Avenue where several major hospitals are located in Toronto.
Often in the winter months this involves her travelling through "street 
slush" (See Figure 1) and the road salt used extensively on Toronto 
streets (See Figure 2). Mingmei then tracks this salty street slush into the 
various hospitals necessitating the already hard-working hospital staff to 
clean it up or risk injuries such as slipping on the melting slush. Most 
hospital entrances have entrance matting designed to allow pedestrians 
to wipe snow, slush and salt off their footwear (See Figure 3). Flowever, 
because Mingmei uses a wheelchair, she is unable to use this matting.

Mingmei, in partnership with the Ontario Disability Coalition, would like 
a design solution that enables a wheelchair user to clean the snow, slush in Toronto in the winter. [1] 

Figure 1: "Street slush" is common \

and salt off their wheels by themselves when entering a building.

Design considerations:

• Hospitals are often busy with people in urgent need. Therefore, 
the design should be fast to use. Ideally, the time it takes to use 
the design must be comparable to the time it takes non­

wheelchair users to clear slush and salt off boots using a 
standard entrance mat (See Figure 3). If that is not possible, then 
this time difference should be minimized.

Figure 3: Road salt used on Toronto 
streets in the winter months. [2]

Figure 2: Heavy duty carpet inserts and aiuminum rails place perpendicular to the entrance for wiping snow, dirt and moisture 
off pedestrian's footwear. The recess well underneath the metal mat collects dirt and moisture. [3]

Mingmei and many other wheelchair users are fiercely independent. She is not interested in a 

design which requires someone else's help to use.

The design should use a brush mechanism because it is simple to use and will be durable. 

Designs that require individual upgrades to wheelchairs are acceptable, but are less desirable 
than designs that place no requirements for modifications on the user's wheelchair.

Likewise, designs that do not require wheelchair users to carry around tools will be easier to get 
people to adopt.

This design is meant to minimize additional work created for hospital caretaking staff by 
individuals tracking in slush and salt.

A typical manual wheelchair weighs 35 lbs to 60 lbs. Motorized wheelchairs can weight up to 
250 lbs depending on the power of the motor [4]. The design should accommodate all typical 

wheelchairs. The weight of users is more difficult to define. A nominal user weight range is 100 
lbs to over 225 lbs [5].

Hidden moisture can be a breeding ground for bacteria which is a major concern in a hospital 
setting. Therefore, if the design must either temporarily store or move the salty meltwater 
outside. If temporary storage is needed the design must minimize the work needed to empty 
the storage container.

Tipping and falling to the ground is a concern for wheelchair users. Often users tip when they 
reach far enough out of the chair to move the centre of gravity beyond the wheels. Designs 
should minimize this tipping hazard.

Salt is very corrosive to metals. Therefore, mental components are not allowed in the design.
