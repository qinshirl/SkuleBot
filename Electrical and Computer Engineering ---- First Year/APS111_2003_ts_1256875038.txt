Midterm Examination 

October 28, 2003 

This is a 1 hour and 50 minute exam.  The midterm is closed book and closed notes.  The only 
permissible aid is a single, 8.5”x11”, aid sheet.  Answer all parts of all questions.  Your answers 
must be well structured, clear, concise, and complete in order to obtain the maximum credit.  The 
mark values for each question are given to help you allocate your time.  You may write your 
answers directly on this sheet, or in the booklet provided.  For short answer questions an 
approximate (not required) length is given in parentheses with the question. 

At the end of the midterm period please submit: this sheet, your answer booklet(s), and your aid 
sheet. 

Please write clearly.  We cannot give you marks if we cannot read your work. 

Exam: 3 pages

Question 1:  The design process 
5 parts,  35 points 

After graduation you get a job working as a design engineer with a small consulting company.  
Your first client is Sarah Doe who lost the use of one of her arms in an accident.  She enjoys 
cooking, but has found that her disability sometimes makes it difficult to perform tasks in the 
kitchen quickly and easily.   

Client statement: 

“I really like to bake, but the hardest part is mixing the ingredients.  Like for instance, 
making whip cream is very difficult because I have to whisk quickly with my good hand but 
then the bowl doesn’t stay still and it is very tiring.  What I really want is a mechanical 
eggbeater I can use.  I know the only mechanical device possible is one of those mechanical 
eggbeaters with the grip at the top and the turning handle, but I can’t use it because this thing 
requires two good hands.  Can you make a device that will hold the gripping handle tightly in 
place for me?  Then I can turn the handle with my good hand and beat things.” 

a)   Identify problems with the client statement 

Clearly we are missing information about the client, her age, where she lives, etc.  However, 
let’s just focus on the client’s statement for the moment.  Briefly (one sentence each), give 
two specific problems with this client statement. 

b)  From the client statement one of the other engineers on your team develops the list below.  
The first four items are identified as objectives.   Identify the other items, E through L, by 
putting an O for objective, a C for constraint, an F for function, or an X if it is none of these, 
next to each item. 

A.   The artefact should be reliable. 

__Objective___ 

B.   The artefact should be easy to use with one hand. 

__Objective___ 

C.   The artefact should be inexpensive.   

__Objective___ 

D.   The artefact should be safe to use.  

E.   The artefact shall not cost more than $20. 

F.   The artefact should be easy to clean.  

__Objective___ 

_____________ 

_____________ 

G.   The artefact should convert power to a whipping action. 

_____________ 

H.   The artefact should be made of metal. 

_____________ 

I. 

 The artefact must not require more than one hand to use.  _____________ 

J.  During whipping, the artefact should not cause the  

bowl to move in an uncontrolled way.  

_____________ 

K.  The artefact should use gears to adjust the torque/speed ratio. 

_____________ 

L.   The artefact should be recycle-able when it is thrown away. _____________

Question 1; continued 

c)  The list, A through L, does include some function(s) of the artefact.  Give one other 

unintended function that the eggbeater may have.  Hint: Think about the eggbeaters you 
analyzed in class.  (1 or 2 sentences) 

d)  Why is it important to list this unintended function when considering the design of an artefact 
for Ms. Doe? (3 sentences or so, be specific about this case, i.e. this unintended function that 
you have written in part c)  

e)  Briefly (bullet points) give the next 5 steps (or actions) you and your team might take to 

address Ms. Doe’s design need. 

Question 2:  Module 2 
4 parts, 25 points 

Note:  for short answer questions the number of sentences given in parentheses is an 
approximate, suggested length.  It is not the required length for the answer. 

a)  Consider the mechanical eggbeater analyzed in tutorial.  What would happen if the turning 
handle on the mechanical eggbeater were shorter?  Would it be easier or harder to use the 
beater?  Why? (3 sentences, be specific) 

b)  In tutorial you analyzed two of three mechanical products: a can opener or a corkscrew, and 

an eggbeater.  Give one example where an inclined plane is used in one of these three 
products. (1 sentence) 

c)  What is wrong with perfectly symmetric pushbars on doors?  (3 sentences) 

d)  A swimsuit that copies the surface (skin) characteristics of a shark to reduce drag is most 

likely an example of which of the following type of analogies used in synectics? 
a.  Fantasy analogy 
b.  Personal analogy 
c.  Symbolic analogy 
d.  Direct analogy

Question 3:  Module 1 
1 part, 40 points 

Long answer question 
Compare and contrast the design process, the team development process, and the writing process.  
For example the design process has a goal or objective, as do the team and writing processes.  
Please note that this portion of the exam will be marked for the clarity, conciseness and logical 
flow of the writing as well as the content.  It is strongly recommended that you write a brief 
outline for yourself before you begin writing the full text of your response.  This outline should 
be in your examination booklet should you choose to do it.
