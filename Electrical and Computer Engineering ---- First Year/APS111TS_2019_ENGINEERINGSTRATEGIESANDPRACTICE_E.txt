Final Exam RFP: Security System 
for Foldable Electric Car 

At the Toronto-based start-up, Vision 20/20 Inc., we are in the business of creating products for the 

future. As such, we are seeking proposals for a security device for electric folding cars. Three such 

automobile designs currently exist: 

-  The Hiriko developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a Spanish redevelopment 

agency, DENOKINN [1]; 

-  The Armadillo-T developed by the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) [2]; 

-  The Casple Podadera developed by the Spanish business group Casple and the designer Francisco 

Podadera [3].

easuring between 2.30 and 2.80 metres in use and between 1.65 and 1.90 metres when folded [1-3], 

these two person vehicles are the ultimate answer to the challenges of city driving and city parking! Up 
to three of these could fit in a conventional Toronto parking space (5.6*2.6  metres) [4].  So, how it works 
is, the driver finds a parking spot about a third of the size of a normal spot, gets out of the car, folds it 

and parks it through a smart phone app. 

However, at Vision 20/20, we foresee a major drawback for these cars. They are so light (the Hiroki is a 

mere 452Kg [1] and the Armadillo-T is 3 Kg [2] lighter than that), they could easily be lifted and carried 

away by a small number of strong people with a minimal amount of equipment. 

So, we believe that as these new foldable electric cars start to come on the market, there will be a need 

for a security device that prevents unauthorized removal of the vehicle while allowing law enforcement 

to tow when necessary. It would also be desirable for the security system to warn the car owner in the 

case of the car being moved. However, any such alarm system cannot create a disturbance if the car is 

parked in a residential neighbourhood at night. Finally, if an electrical source or a source of energy 

transformable to electrical power is available, it would be an added benefit if the security system could 

also charge the car's battery while the car is parked. In the case of this add-on, electromagnetic systems 

would be preferred.

1. Circle T (TRUE) or F (False) for each statement below. If the answer is FALSE, then 
rewrite the entire statement to make the statement TRUE. There may be multiple 
ways to do this, just pick one. [1 Mark each; total 9 Marks] 

[T or F]: The purpose of an engineering argument is to market. 

[T or F]: The purpose of the Project Report (PR) is to define the solution. 

[T or F]: The purpose of the Measures of Success is to persuade the client that 
your recommended design is the right design for them. 

[T or F]: Idea selection defines the client's need by specifying the boundaries of the 
design problem. 

[T or F]: The purpose of prototyping the design is to test the success of a design. 

[T or F]: Design reports are written using a process called concision. 

[T or F]: Considering the most-to-least way to prevent negative environmental 
impact, an engineering designer would: Reuse, Reduce, Recycle. 

[T or F]: Every communication assignment should begin with research. 

[T or F]: A constraint goal is the metric that the design tries to meet.

2. The design process is iterative in nature and a successful conceptual design will go 

through multiple processes, multiple times, before a final design is achieved. Draw an 
overview of the engineering design process that shows the iterative cycles that 
engineers go through during a typical engineering design. [10 Marks] 

Take a holistic approach that clearly demonstrates your understanding of the overall 
engineering design process. Include as many stages as possible and avoid listing 
topics like FOC. Take note: Your answer must be drawn and labelled.

Foldable Electric Car 

3. Identify the functionality of the problem using the three steps below (3.a to 3.c) 

a. Write a Gap for the problem. [3 Marks] 

Write a Functional Basis for the problem. It must be linked to your Gap. [3 Marks]

5. Perform a communication assessment. [5 Marks] 

6. Write two Constraints complete with metric. (Limits not required) [4 Marks] 

7. Write three Objectives complete with metric (goal is not needed). List them in order of 

importance and give evidence of this ranking. [6 Marks]

8. Identify three key Stakeholders upon whom the design will have significant impact and 

describe the impact. Avoid the client, user or design team. [3 Marks] 

9. Identify three specific aspects of the Service Environment. [3 Mark] 

Page 7 of 12 

10. Using two different idea generation methods, other than Brainstorming/Enumeration, 
generate and describe two feasible design alternatives. Identify which method was 
used for each design and why was it used. The more innovative and distinctly different 
the approach of the design alternatives, the more marks you will receive. [12 Marks] 

Page 8 of 12 

11 . Using the three Objectives you generated above and a Weighted Decision Matrix, 

recommend one of your alternative designs to the client. This recommendation must 
use the SEE structure for a credible argument as discussed in class. [12 Marks] 

Page 9 of 12 

12. Identify the impact of your recommended design on one Stakeholder and on one 

Environmental Factor. Provide justification and an action plan to mitigate the impact. 
[6 Marks] 

13. Using the three Objective you identified above, provide a detailed plan on how to 

evaluate the performance of your recommended design. Include measurements, tests 
and other engineering methods in this performance evaluation. [6 Marks] 

Page 10 of 12 

14. If you were tasked with this RFP, you would need to do more research. With regard to 
Performance Measure, give three examples of research questions/areas you need to 
investigate and the type of source that would provide credible information. [3 Marks]
