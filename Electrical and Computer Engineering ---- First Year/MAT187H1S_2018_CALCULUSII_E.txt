LONG ANSWER PART 

11.  A railroad company plans to lay railroad tracks on a flat plain. The tracks can 

(20 marks) 

be modelled as a curve y = f(x) 

for some function  f(x).  You can assume z = 0. 

Note. You can use the results of previous parts even if you didn't solve them. 

(a) (7 marks) Show that the curvature of the track at a point (x, f(x), 0) is 

If"(x) I 

a 
(1+ fl(x)2)2 

Hint. Calculations are easier with the cross product formula.

(b) (3 marks) Show that  ic < If"(x)I. 

(4 marks) To bypass two farms in the path, between —2 

x < 6 the track goes along the 

curve y = a cos(bx) shown in the figure for some a> 0 and b> 0. What are a and b? 

(6 marks) The maximum curvature of the track must not exceed 2. Is the track in (c) 

acceptable? Justify your answer.

12.  Consider the irregular baseball field in the figure. 

(20 marks) 

The field is bounded by lines with angles —a and 7r/2 + a 

for some small angle a. 

The curve that separates the outfield and the infield is given 

by a circle of radius  '/  centred at the point (1, 1). 

(5 marks) Write a formula for the circle in x-y-coordinates. 

(5 marks) Write the formula r = f(0) for the circle in polar coordinates. Justify your answer. 

Hint. Use the formulas x = rcos(0) and y = rsin(0).

- 5y' + 4y = 10 cos (2x) 

and the initial conditions 

y(0) = 3 

and 

y'(0)  = 10. 

(a) (5 marks) Find the Taylor polynomial p2(x) = Co + CX + c2x2 of degree m = 2 centred at a = 0 
for the solution  y(x)  of the above equation without solving the differential equation. Justify 

your answer. (You will be asked to solve the differential equation in part (b) below.)
