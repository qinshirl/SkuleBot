1.  A  weight  block  is  subjected  to  the  forces  shown. 

Determine the resultant force, using 

the parallelogram rule, 

i) 
ii)  the polygon rule (using trigonometry), 
iii)  the rectangular components method, and 
iv)  the polygon rule (using a scaled drawing). 

2.  A  steel  bracket  is  subjected  to  the  forces  shown.  In 
order  for  the  resultant  force  to  be  directed  along  the 
positive y axis, determine the magnitude and direction 
(i.e., θ) of F1 if F1 is to be a minimum. 

3.  If cable AB can withstand a maximum force of 

4000 N, determine the maximum force in cable BC and 
the distance y so that 300-kg crate can be supported. 

4.  A gusset plate is subjected to the forces shown. 

Determine the force F1 and the angle θ for equilibrium.
