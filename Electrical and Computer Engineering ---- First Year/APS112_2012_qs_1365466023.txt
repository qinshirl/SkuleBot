Questions 16 through 18 are regarding Case Study #1.  

Case Study #1 
From a materials’ point of view, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner represents an enormous advance in 
aircraft design and manufacturing. Its use of structural composites is more comprehensive than 
any other previous commercial aircraft. Its immediate predecessor, the Boeing 777 is 9% 
composites by weight, compared to 50% for the Boeing 787. The epoxy/carbon fiber matrices in 
the new aircraft are intended to reduce weight, allowing fuel savings and extended flying range. 
[1] 

Introducing the new technology created three key challenges: 

•  Having 50% of the primary structure of the aircraft – including the fuselage and wing – 

made of composites represented a manufacturing challenge. [2] No one ever attempted to 
mass produce very large carbon-reinforced plastic structures, which are thermoset 
materials with significantly slower processing times than thermoplastics,  

•  The critical tooling for such large sections was only in the development stage and, 

therefore, represented a source of delay in the project development plan,

•  New coatings had to be developed to deal with the crack propagation issues, which are 

not a factor with aluminum. [1] 

On the other hand, a lot was known about composites. “When we made the decision on 
composites’ use in the wings, fuselage, floor beams and so on, we went down a path based on a 
material that we had already had a significant amount of production experience with (in the 
Boeing 777),” says Dr. Alan G. Miller, director of technology integration on the 787 and former 
chief engineer for all materials technology at Boeing. “We knew the things like dimensional 
stability. We knew how composites impacted the manufacturing flows. We had a lot of design 
allowables databases. We had a lot of confidence from our customers.” [1]

Questions 23 to 25 are regarding Case Study #2.  

Case Study #2 
A simple crane is to be used to haul 2000 kg loads 
from the ground to the top of a 30 story apartment 
building. The cable is unwound from a spool at the 
back of the crane and must reach the ground from 
the top (See Figure 2). 

Note: For steel: Failure stress ~ 400 MPa, Density ~ 
7900 kg/m^3. Stress = Force/Area. 

23. What design for safety consideration would be 

used to ensure that the cable or crane did not fail (snap!) in service? [2 marks] 

Figure 2 - Crane 

24. The crane operator sits at the very top of the crane. Can the hazard (workers on ground being 
hit by the swinging bucket) be eliminated? How else would you keep the workers on the 
ground kept safe when the load is being lifted? [2 marks]

25. Estimate how much the steel cable will weigh, so that you know how big a truck is needed 
to bring the cable to the building site. You must provide a specific numerical estimate using 
a Fermi or “Back of the Envelope” type calculation. Show the various steps used in the 
estimation. You must use the data for steel provided. [3 marks]
