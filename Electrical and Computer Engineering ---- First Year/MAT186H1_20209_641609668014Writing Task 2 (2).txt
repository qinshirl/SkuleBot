1. Consider the following 

Fermi estimation 

problem.  

“If in 2014, you had downloaded all the data on the entire internet, burned the data onto 

CDs

, and stacked the CDs on top of each other, how tall would the stack be?”  

Find upper and lower bounds for what the height of the stack might be. State any assumptions about 

data you use in your calculations.  

First, I need to find upper and lower bounds for the amount of data on the internet in 2014.  

Live Science that the amount of data on the internet in 2014 was 1 million exabytes [1]. ACI said 

that in 2013, the amount of data on the internet increased by 5 exabytes per day [2]. This would 

mean that the amount of data by the start of 2014 was 5 * 365 = 1825 exabytes of data. Hence, a 

lower and upper bound can be created: 

The amount of CDs that it would take to store a certain amount of data is equal to the amount of 

data divided by the amount of data an average CD can hold. According to Andrea Stein of 

6
​ bytes, of data[3]. Dividing 
ItStillWorks.com, the average CD can hold 700 megabytes, or 700 * 10

the expression by this value yields: 

The total height of a stack of CDs would be the amount of CDs multiplied by the average height of 1 

CD. According to Britannica.com, the average height of 1 CD is 1.2 mm, or 0.0012 metres [4]. 

Multiplying the expression by this value gives us our answer 

​

Rounding off gives 

Quite the range! 

2. Find the following limit, fully justifying your reasoning using mathematical principles we have covered. 

Remember to use complete sentences as part of your response.  

Since there is a sine in the function, I will start off by trying squeeze theorem 

The bounds for sine are 

2
​ to both sides: 
Adding x

To get the original function in the middle, we would have to raise each part of the inequality to the power of 

negative 1. However, to do so, we would also have to flip the direction of the inequalities because if 

, then 

 since a larger denominator means a smaller fraction. Hence, 

 
 
 
 
 
​
 
To get the function we are trying to find the limit of in the centre, we just multiply by x - 2: 

Let 

 be equal to the function on the left and 
g(x)
​

 be equal to the function on the right 
h(x)
​

And 

Therefore, since 

 
 
​
​
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And 

We can conclude that 

3. In three sentences or less, reflect on the similarities and differences in the the math used to solve these problem 

Both questions were similar in that they both required the manipulation of a double inequality. However, question 

1 required me to do my own research to create bounds and then use more research to find a range for a value, 

meaning the nature of the question required inequalities. On the other hand, question 2 required me to find the 

value of a limit, where the double inequality came into play as a result of a mathematical theorem that I chose to 

approach the problem with, meaning the nature of the question was not about inequalities but rather inequalities 

were simply a tool used in the method that I chose for the question and the question does not necessarily need 

inequalities to be solved.
