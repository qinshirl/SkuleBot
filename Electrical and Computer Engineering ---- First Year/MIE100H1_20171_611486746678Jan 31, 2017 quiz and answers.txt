1.  The blocks “M” and “E” can slide horizontally on the floor. They are attached to a system of 4 pulleys and 
two ropes as shown.  Assume both ropes remain taut at all times. Both blocks move only in the horizontal 
direction, without rotation. The acceleration of block “M” is not constant, and is given by the following 
formula in S.I. units: 

(cid:3040)

(cid:3051)

 (cid:1853)(cid:1318) (cid:3404)

(cid:3046)(cid:3118) 	(cid:2835)̂ 
At time t = 0, the position of block “M” is {x,y} = {8, 3 } meters,  
and its velocity is:  (cid:1874)(cid:1318) (cid:3404) (cid:3398)2

		(cid:2835)̂ 

(cid:2873)(cid:2868)

(cid:3040)

(cid:3046)

(a)  Express the initial velocity of block “M” in  
polar (r - ) coordinates, based on the origin  
“O” and direction of angle  indicated in  
the diagram.

(b)  Determine the velocity of block “E” at  

time t=0 in x-y coordinates. 

(c)  What will be the position of block “M”  
in x-y coordinates when its velocity  
reaches 2.3 m/s  (cid:2835)̂?

2.  The small particle P starts from rest at the point {x,y} = {-3, 3.5} meters at time t = 0. It then speeds up 
to the right at a constant rate of 19.6 m/s2 as it follows the curved track. The rounded portion of the track 
has a radius of curvature of 3.5 m. 

(a)  What is the velocity of P in r- co-ordinates when it reaches point B? (The coordinate  is measured 

relative to the x-axis in the direction shown in the diagram.) 

(b) What are the values of 	(cid:1870)(cid:4663) and  (cid:2016)(cid:4663) when particle P reaches point C, expressed in S.I. units?  

(c)  What is the acceleration of P as it passes point C in normal-tangential co-ordinates?
