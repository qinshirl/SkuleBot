Computer Fundamentals
Tuesday, September 28

All quizzes, tests, and exams in this course are closed book with no calculators.

1. Consider the following piece of C code:

2
marks

double i = 3.1;
int j = 2;
int k = 4;
k += k/j + i;
i++;
j = j % 2;

In the boxes below, write down the (cid:2)nal value of i, j and k after the last statement is
executed.

i : 4.1

j : 0

k : 9

2. Write a single C statement that declares an integer variable i and initializes i to an even ran- 2
dom number between 100 and 200 inclusive. You may assume that the stdlib.h library
has already been included.

marks

int i = (rand() % 51)*2 + 100;

3. Write a complete C program that prompts the user for a double value corresponding to a 6
distance in miles, reads the value into a variable of type double named miles, converts
the distance in miles into a distance in kilometres, and then prints the distance in kilometres
to four decimal places. Your program should assume that one mile is equivalent to 1.61
kilometres. Input and output must be done with scanf and printf. A sample run of the
program is below. Your output must conform to this format.

marks

Please input a number in miles: 10.0
The distance in kilometres is: 16.1000.

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)

{

}

double miles;
double km;

printf("Please input a number in miles: ");
scanf("%lf", &miles);
km = miles * 1.61;
printf("The distance in kilometres is: %.4f.\n", km);

return 0;
