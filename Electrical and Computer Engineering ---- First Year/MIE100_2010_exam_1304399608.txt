Question 1 

An object, P, travels along y = 4 with velocity 
axes is metres.  A camera is positioned at the origin, O, and is aimed to track the motion of P. 

  m/s.  The scale on both the 

 and y 

(i)  Using polar co-ordinates centered at O as shown, what is the rate of rotation of the 

camera,

, when θ = 45o?  [15 marks] 

(ii) What is 

 when θ = 45o?  [20 marks]

Question 2 

A rock of mass 4 kg is tied to the end of a rope of length 5 meters. The other end of the rope is 
tied to a hook in the ceiling. Let β represent the angle measured in the counter-clockwise 
direction between the ceiling and the rope. The rock is released from rest when β = 0. 

(i)  What will be the speed of the rock when β reaches 60°?  [10 marks] 

(ii) What will be the magnitude of the tangential component of the acceleration when β 

reaches 70°?  [10 marks] 

(iii) What will be the tension in the rope when β reaches 60°?  [10 marks]

Question 3 

The collar B of mass 5.75 kg is initially at rest at the position shown.  At this position, the spring 
(k=400 N/m) is unstretched and  = 0.9 m.  The collar A of mass 0.5 kg strikes collar B at a 
velocity of 40 m/s to the right so that B slides a distance of 1.2 m on the smooth rod before 
momentarily stopping.  Assume there is no friction. 

(i)  Determine the velocity of collar A just after impact.  [25 marks] 

(ii) Find the magnitude of the average force exerted between A and B during the impact if the 

impact occurs over a duration of 0.002 s.  [10 marks]
