f (x) dx. Explain in words why using Simpson’s Rule to estimate I is likely to be

more accurate than using the Trapezoid rule to estimate I.

a

Since Simpson’s rule is based on Quadratic interpolation rather than the Linear interpolation used for
the Trapezoid rule, the interpolation used with Simpson’s Rule will more closely match the function f
compared to the linear interpolations used with the Trapezoid rule. Since the function is more closely
approximated, the integral will be more closely approximated.

restrictions. If no such function exists, you are to mark the option “No such f exists”.

Note: if you feel like your drawing is unclear, you may add a description in words below your graph.

8. Pam, an astronomer, wants to determine the mass of a planet of radius 106 metres. Using spectroscopy,
Pam has determined the chemical makeup of the planet and used this information to estimate the radial
density of the planet (i.e., the density r metres from its centre). The estimate is given by

˜ρ(r) =

1
r2(r + 4)

in units of kilograms per metre cubed.
In the following questions, you may use the fact that the mass of a sphere with radial density ρ(r) and
radius R is given by the formula

(cid:90) R

M =

4πr2 · ρ(r) dr.

(a) (2 points) Based on Pam’s calculations, she has determined that |˜ρ(r) − ρ(r)| ≤ 1

100, where ρ(r) is

the true radial density of the planet.
Using this information, set up an integral that gives the best possible upper bound for the mass,
M , of the planet. Do not evaluate your integral.

(b) After reading Pam’s paper on planet mass, her graduate student, Alice, suggests a correction. Alice
claims that the uncertainty in the radial density of the planet is greater near its core than at the
outer edges.
Pam and Alice have the following exchange:

Alice: A better bound to use would be |˜ρ(r) − ρ(r)| ≤ 1
of the planet at radius r.
Pam: But at r = 0, that bound is invalid.
Alice: If we use improper integrals, we can arrive at a bound even if some of the functions
are undefined at a particular point.

number) bound on the mass of the planet? Provide a well-written justification.

Will not provide a valid bound

To evaluate the improper integral from part ii, we first compute

dr

= 4π ln(r + 4) + π ln r − π ln(r + 4) + C

= 3π ln(r + 4) + π ln r + C

Now, using this antiderivative to compute the improper integral, we see

(cid:16)

3π ln(r + 4) + π ln r + C

k

= 3π ln(106 + 4) + π ln(106) − 3π ln 4 − π ln k = ∞,

and so the improper integral diverges. This means that the bound coming from Alice’s sug-
gestion is not helpful and is not a real-number.
