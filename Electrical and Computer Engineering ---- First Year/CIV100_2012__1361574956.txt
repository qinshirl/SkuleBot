1.  A pin-connected pulley-rod-and-cable system carries 

a crate as shown. Determine: 

i.)   Support reactions at C and E, 
ii.) All force components acting on member ABC

2.  Determine the components of the reactions at A and B,  

i.)  if the load is applied as shown. 
ii.)  if the load is moved along its line of action and is  

applied at F. 

Show all results on a new free body diagram. 

3.  A pin-connected pulley-and-rod system carries a force as 

shown. Knowing that each pulley  has a radius of 250 mm, 
determine  
i.)   Support reactions at D and E, 
ii.) The force components that pins A and B exert on
  member ABD.

4.   The truss in Question 2 of Problem Set 6 is to be manufactured from structural steel with a 

yield stress of 350 MPa and a modulus of elasticity of 200000 MPa. 

i.)  If the force in member AE is 105 kN tension, determine a square cross section for a load 
factor of 1.9. Determine the actual axial stress, axial deformation and axial strain in the 
selected section. Assume that square steel bar sizes are available in increments of 5 mm.   

ii.)  If the force in member BF is 100 kN compression and the cross section used is 

L75x75x10, determine the load factor used in the design of this member. Consider both 
material yielding and elastic buckling. Comment on the structural adequacy of the 
section.
