Page 2 of 4 

•  Consider two concentric conductors, an inner sphere of radius 2 cm 
and an outer spherical shell of radius 6 cm as shown in the figure. 

•  The inner sphere has a positive charge and the outer spherical shell 
has a negative charge equal in magnitude to that of the inner sphere. 

•  The magnitude of the electric field is 9.94x106 N/C at r = 4 cm in 

the space halfway between the two concentric conductors. 

(a)  Compute the total flux through the surface of the inner sphere. (3 marks)
