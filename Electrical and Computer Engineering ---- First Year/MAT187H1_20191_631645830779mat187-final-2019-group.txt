3. You work for a roller coaster construction company and Canada’s Wonderland

(6 marks)

is asking you to design a new ride. Your job is to design a speciﬁc part of the ride.

The trajectory should follow the curve given by

(cid:126)r(t) =

(cid:90) t

b

in metres,

for 0 (cid:54) t (cid:54) 10 seconds.

Consider parts (a) and (b) as independent.

(a) (1 mark) Riders should never exceed a speed of 50 m/s. What are the restrictions on b and c?

Your answer should not include t. Justify your answer.

(b) (1 mark) Taking safety and durability into account, the curvature should not exceed 1

10 m−1.
What are the restrictions on b and c? Your answer should not include t. Justify your answer.

Note. For this question, do not use the restrictions that you found in (a).

(c) (1 mark) Give values b (cid:54)= 0 and c (cid:54)= 0 that fulﬁl all the above design requirements. Your answer

should not include t. Justify your answer.

(d) (1 mark) Your manager asked you to calculate (cid:126)r(1) .

Approximate using Taylor polynomials of degree 4 centred at 0. Justify your answer.
