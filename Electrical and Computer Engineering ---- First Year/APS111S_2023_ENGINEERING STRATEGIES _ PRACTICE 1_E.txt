AU questions pertain to the Client Statement: The Ultimate Commuter Student Backpack

1. If you were working on this Client Statement, you would need to conduct research. Give THREE 
research questions you would need to investigate. For each question, give a TYPE of source that 
would provide credible information to answer that question. In other words, where would you go to 
find this information? [6 Marks; <50 words]

2.

Identify the functionality for the design problem using the four steps below (2.a to 2.d)

a.

Identify ONE Gap for the Client Statement. Making direct reference to the Client Statement, 
justify and explain why you are defining the “Gap” this way? Identify ONE “Need” based on 
this “Gap”. If you give more than one, only the first will be marked. [3 Marks; <25 words]

b. Write ONE Functional Basis for the Client Statement that addresses the Gap in Question 2.a. You 
must use one of the specific components/flows associated with Functional Basis, and one action 
or operation. This Functional Basis must use the proper two-component format without qualifiers. 
If you give more than one Functional Basis, only the first will be marked. [2 Marks; 2-3 words]

c. Write ONE Primary Function based on the above Functional Basis in Question 2.b. If you give 

more than one Primary Function, only the first one will be marked. [2 Marks; 10 words]

d.

Use Functional Decomposition to derive THREE Secondary Functions. Fill in the Functional 
Decomposition chart (below), including your Primary Function and three Secondary Functions. 
Do not include more than THREE Secondary Functions. If you do, only the first three will be 
marked. [3 Marks; <25 words]

3. Identify ONE important aspect of the Service Environment from the Client Statement. Give evidence 
and explain your claim. If you identify more than one aspect, only the first will be marked. [3 Mark;

4.

Based on how you identified functionality in Question 2, identify Objectives for the design problem 
in the sections below (parts 4.a - 4.b).

a.

Write THREE Objectives for this design problem, including a metric (a goal is not required). 
Do NOT include more than THREE Objectives. If you do, only the first three will be 
marked. You are not required to support these metrics with research, as you normally would 
in a design document. [3 Marks; 150 words]

b. Use a Pairwise Comparison table to rank these Objectives. Include this table in the space 

below and make the final ranking of your Objectives clear. While you do not have access to 
external research, make reasonable estimations and provide justification to enhance the 
persuasiveness of your final rankings. [4 Marks; <100 words]

5.

Ideate using a Morphological Chart. Using your Secondary Functions from Question 2, complete the 
table below. You should put your Secondary Functions down the initial column and the Means 
across each row. Include THREE Means for each of your three Secondary Functions. If you include 
more than three, only the first three will be marked. The more innovative and distinctly different the 
Means are, the more marks you will receive. You may include a labelled sketch, but it is not 
required. Draw lines through this Morphological Chart to generate THREE complete solutions that 
you will discuss further in Question 6. [9 marks; <100 words]

6. Describe THREE feasible design alternatives (from the Morphological Chart in Question 5) for this 
Client Statement using a parallel, multimodal approach. The more innovative and distinctly different 
the approaches of the design alternatives, the more marks you will receive. Describe each design in 
the space provided for that design. If you include more than three designs, only the first three will be 
marked. [9 Marks (3 Marks per Design); <300 words (<100 words per Design)]

7. Using the THREE Objectives generated in Question 4, use the Pugh Method to compare your three 
alternative designs (in Question 6). As you cannot complete any verification, clearly explain your 
reasoning for each comparison. Include your completed Pugh Method chart in the space below. 
Clearly determine and state a recommended alternative design and justify it using the Pugh Chart. [6 
Marks; <150 words]
