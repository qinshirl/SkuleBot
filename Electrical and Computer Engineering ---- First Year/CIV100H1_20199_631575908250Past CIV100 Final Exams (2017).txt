Question 2 
Determine the tension in the cable at B when the 180 N force is applied to the pedal at E. Also, calculate 
the reaction force components at the pins at A and D. If the cable at B has a diameter of 7.0 mm and the 
yield stress of the cable material is 70 MPa, determine the actual load (safety) factor for the cable. In 
your opinion, is this a ‘safe’ design? In all your calculations, neglect friction and the mass of the 
components.

Question 3 
The fresh water channel illustrated can be emptied by opening the 6,300 kg solid gate ABC (represented 
in cross-section). The gate is 5 m wide (into the paper), is pinned at A, rests against the vertical wall at B 
and can be operated by pulling on the cable attached to it at C. Determine the minimum magnitude of 
the force, F, required to open the gate.

Question 5 
The frame shown is supported by a ball-and-socket joint at A and a pin at C. (The pin is similar to a ball-
and-socket joint that was modified to allow translation in the x-direction.) The strut EF has a ball-and-
socket joint at each end. The cable EBD runs over a small frictionless pulley at B and carries a 2,700 N 
weight at D. Neglecting the weight of the members, determine the force exerted by member EF on the 
frame at F and the magnitude of the total reaction at C.

Question 1 
The 7.5 m-long timber floor beam, having a square cross-section, is to be designed to carry the 
loads shown. Because only 5 m-long timbers are available, the beam is to be fabricated from two 
pieces connected together by a nailed joint, D. You are required to: 
(a) In the space provided, draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams for the beam 
indicating the values at points A, B, and C, and any potential local maxima and minima; 
(b) If wood has a strength of 30 MPa, in both tension and compression, determine the required 
size, a, for the beam such that it can safely carry the floor loads. The load factor for timber in 
bending is 1.67; and 
(c) Determine the distance b for the most advantageous position of the joint D, knowing that 
nailed joints are strong in shear but weak in bending.

Question 4 
Determine the force in members BC, CJ, DF, FH, HI and state if the members are in tension or 
compression. Members CJ, DF and FH are to be fabricated using the same circular hollow section 
having an external diameter of 30 mm and a yield stress of 150 MPa. Knowing that the load factor 
for members in axial tension is 1.5, determine the minimum wall thickness of the cross-section, t, 
such that the three members are safe. The wall thickness can be selected in 0.5 mm increments. 
Also, what is the elongation of member DF? The modulus of elasticity for the material is 69,000 
MPa.
