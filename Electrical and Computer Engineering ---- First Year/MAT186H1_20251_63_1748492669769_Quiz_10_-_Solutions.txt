1.  Find the volume of the shape created when the region 
between 𝒚 = 𝟐𝒙𝟐 + 𝟓𝒙 − 𝟐 and 𝒚 = 𝟒 + 𝟐𝒙 − 𝒙𝟐 is 
rotated about the line 𝒙 = 𝟏. 

We begin by equating the functions and finding where they intersect. 

2𝑥2 + 5𝑥 − 2 = 4 + 2𝑥 − 𝑥2 
3𝑥2 + 3𝑥 − 6 = 0 
3(𝑥 + 2)(𝑥 − 1) = 0 

Therefore, 𝑥 = −2,1 are the points of intersection.  The volume is:

𝑉 = 2𝜋 ∫ (−3𝑥2 − 3𝑥 + 6)(1 − 𝑥)𝑑𝑥

2.  Find the volume of the shape created when the same region from question 1 

is rotated about the line 𝒚 = 𝟑. 

This is corrected to the line 𝒚 = 𝟓, as the lower line intersects the graph. 

In that case, we will be dealing with washers. 

The outer radius will be 5 − (4 + 2𝑥 − 𝑥2) and the inner radius 5 − (2𝑥2 + 5𝑥 − 2). 

1

𝑉 = 𝜋 ∫ [5 − (4 + 2𝑥 − 𝑥2)]2 − [5 − (2𝑥2 + 5𝑥 − 2)]2 𝑑𝑥

= 𝜋 ∫ (1 − 2𝑥 + 𝑥2)2 − (7 − 5𝑥 − 2𝑥2)2 𝑑𝑥

−2

Which is ugly enough to leave alone. 

Continued on back. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  A conical tank with height of 3 m and base radius of

2 m is buried under ground, with its base facing up and 4 m below 
ground level.  How much work is required to empty the tank through a 
pipe 1 m above ground?  Leave the density as 𝝆 and the gravity as 𝒈. 

From the diagram, we see the important measurements. 

We can also see two similar triangles that allow us to find 
the cross-section area at any height 𝑦.  The triangles give:

The last few steps are there to demonstrate how this can be done without resorting to 
any three-digit number in your arithmetic.

you try this problem, it will not lower your mark.] 

4.  When two numbers are multiplied together, their product is 𝟒.  What is the smallest 

possible value for their sum? 

Let the numbers be 𝑥 and 𝑦.  Then 𝑥𝑦 = 4, or 𝑦 = 4/𝑥. 

The sum of the numbers is 𝑥 + 𝑦, or 𝑥 + 4/𝑥. 

𝑆(𝑥) = 𝑥 + 4/𝑥 

𝑆′(𝑥) = 1 − 4/𝑥2 

Set 𝑆′(𝑥) ≥ 0 to find both the critical values and areas of increase and decrease. 

1 −

4
𝑥2 ≥ 0 

𝑥2 − 4

𝑥2 ≥ 0 
(𝑥 − 2)(𝑥 + 2)
𝑥2

≥ 0 

No marks are deducted for assuming that the numbers are positive, but that is not actually 
asked for.  Keep in mind that “smallest” means closest to zero. 

On a number line, we get the function increasing for 𝑥 < −2 and 𝑥 > 2.  It is decreasing on 
−2 < 𝑥 < 0 and 0 < 𝑥 < 2. 

At 𝑥 = −2, we have a local maximum of −4.  At 𝑥 = 2, we have a local minimum of 4.  As 
𝑥 → 0 from either side, the sum diverges to ±∞.  Therefore, these two sums (4 and −4) are 
the smallest possible values.
