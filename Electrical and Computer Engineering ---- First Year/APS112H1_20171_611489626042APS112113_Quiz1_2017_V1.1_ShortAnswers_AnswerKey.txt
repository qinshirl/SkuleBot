There are 3 short-answer questions, worth 21 marks in total. These must be answered 
in the spaces provided in this Short-Answer Question Booklet. This question booklet, 
with your name and UTOR Email filled in, must be returned with the multiple-choice 
answer sheet slipped inside. Do not separate any pages. Do not write on the QR code 
at the top of the pages. We are not looking for long paragraph answers. Use short 
sentences or bullet points. 

All short-answer questions refer to the following client statement. 

Client Statement #2 – Photovoltaic Cells 
Performance of photovoltaic systems greatly degrade as dust and dirt adhere to the 
panels. As a result, water based washing systems have been developed to clean 
photovoltaic systems. Unfortunately, many locations which are suitable to photovoltaic 
systems have limited water availability (sunny skies means no rain). Design a water 
efficient method for keeping large photovoltaic power systems clean.

1.  (7 MARKS) Give ONE primary function, TWO important objectives, and ONE 
important constraint for Client Statement #2 – Photovoltaic Cells. Metrics are 
required for the objectives and constraint, but you do not need to include goals or 
limits.  

PRIMARY FUNCTION: 
•  Remove dirt and dust from panel 
•  Clean solar panel 

NOT:  
•  Transport Mass (we want primary function, not the functional basis) 
•  Minimize  water  (Though  this  is  a  critical  aspect  of  the  project,  it  is  an  objective  not  a 

function) 
Increase solar cell efficiency (this is a result and not a function) 

• 
•  Store water (this is a secondary function) 
•  Detect dirt/dust (this is a secondary function) 

OBJECTIVES: 
•  Should minimize water usage 

o  Litres per unit of time; Litres per panel; Litres 

•  Should minimize electricity usage 

o  Watts 

•  Should be easy to operate 

o  Number of daily human interactions required for operation 

•  Should be inexpensive 
o  Dollars 
•  Should be durable 

o  Number of moving parts; % of constructions materials that are non-oxidizing  

•  Should be easy to maintain 

o  Number of standardized parts; number of locally accessible parts 

NOT:  
•  Should clean efficiently (too vague…unless they give enough details using the metric) 
•  Should  be  environmentally  friendly  (too  vague…unless  they  give  enough  details  using 

the metric) 

•  Should be user friendly (too vague…unless they give enough details using the metric) 

CONSTRAINT: 
Must not use toxic cleaner 

o  EPA toxicity guidelines; litres 
•  Must not require water service line 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Yes / no 
•  Must collect runoff water 

o  Litres 

•  Must not contain oxidizing materials. 

o  % by volume, % by mass, mass 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  (7 MARKS) While designing a solution for Client Statement #2 – Photovoltaic Cells, 

you need to know the amount of water consumed washing panels at the 550 
Megawatt (MW) Desert Sunlight Solar Farm in the Mojave Desert. If the panels are 
washed twice a week in the traditional way, estimate the annual water consumption 
for this task in Litres. Use reasonable assumptions based on your personal 
knowledge and the information provided here. You don’t have to get an exact 
answer, but you do have to compute a number and demonstrate structured 
thinking.

To remove dirt properly, perhaps need to flush 10 times 

So Vol water per panel would be 5 L per panel (similar to Method #1 that gave 10L per 
panel per wash)

NOTE: 
Note  that  on  the  web,  I  found  they  clean  only  2  x  per  year.    The  number  I  got  was 
~60,000L per MW 
For  550  MW  this  would  come  to  33  M  liters.    If  they  only  wash  2  times  per  year,  this 
means each wash would be about 15 M liters/wash 

This is close to the estimates of 14-28 M liters per wash
