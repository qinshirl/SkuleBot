At time t = 0, a particle is located at (x,y) = (5, 2) meters. Its velocity at all times is given by Vx = (3t - 12) m/s, and 
Vy = 7t m/s, where “t” is the time measured in seconds. Make sure you give the correct units in your answers; vectors must have 
the direction clearly specified with respect to the x-axis. 

 at time t = 2 seconds 

(a)  Determine 
(b)  Find the magnitude of the total acceleration at time t = 2 seconds. 
(c)  At time t = 0, what angle (expressed in radians) does the velocity make with respect to the x-axis?
