Instructions
• This is a Type A assessment and does not allow any external aids.
• Read all instructions carefully and justify all your answers. No points will be awarded for a correct

answer without justification.

• Read each question carefully. No clarification or content related questions will be answered.

You may use the following space for scratch work or to continue your solutions if you run out of room. If
you do so, please clearly indicate in the original question that part of your solution appears here.

1. (3 points) True of False: If a sequence {an}n is bounded, then it converges. Justify your answer or

provide a counter-example.

Solution: False. A bounded sequence does not necessarily converge. A bounded monotonic
sequence does.

Counter-example: Consider the sequence an = (−1)n. This sequence is bounded, since all terms
lie between −1 and 1.

However, it does not converge because it oscillates and does not approach a single limit:

a1 = −1,

a2 = 1,

a3 = −1,

a4 = 1,

. . .

2. (3 points) Suppose a power series centered at 5 converges at x = 2. What can you say about its

convergence at x = 7? Explain.

Solution: The power series is centered at x = 5, so its converges up to some distance from the
center (the radius of convergence).

We are told that the series converges at x = 2, which is a distance of

|2 − 5| = 3

from the center. Therefore, the radius of convergence is at least 3.

Now consider the point x = 7, which is at a distance

|7 − 5| = 2

from the center.

Since 2 < 3, and the series converges at a point farther from the center than 7, we can conclude
that the series must also converge at x = 7.

3. (6 points) Starting from the geometric series

n=0 xn,

|x| < 1, find a power series represen-

tation for the function:

Solution: We start with the geometric series:

|x| < 1.

Differentiate both sides with respect to x:

So,

Now multiply both sides by x to get:

f (x) =

(1 − x)2 = x ·

(1 − x)2 =

Thus, the power series representation is:

Solution: We use the Ratio Test to find the radius of convergence. Let

So, the radius of convergence is R = 3, and the series converges for x ∈ (−1, 5).

5. Consider a mechanical system in which a damped spring is compressed, released, and oscillates in-
definitely. The displacement amplitude after each bounce is reduced by a constant factor r, where
0 < r < 1, due to energy loss from damping. The system starts with amplitude A0, and each cycle
takes the same amount of time.

Each oscillation releases energy proportional to the square of the amplitude. That is, the energy
released in the first oscillation is E1 = kA2
(a) (6 points) Show that the total energy dissipated by the system over all time is finite, and find a

formula for it in terms of k, A0, and r.

Solution: The total energy dissipated is the sum of the energy released during each oscillation:

Etotal = kA2

0 + k(rA0)2 + k(r2A0)2 + · · · = kA2
0

(cid:0)1 + r2 + r4 + r6 + · · · (cid:1)

This is a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio r2, where 0 < r2 < 1. The sum of an
infinite geometric series (cid:80)∞

n=0(r2)n is:

Thus,

Since 0 < r < 1, the denominator is positive and finite, so the total energy is finite.

(b) (3 points) Explain what this means about how real-world damped systems behave. Can such

systems dissipate an infinite amount of energy over time?

Solution: This result shows that although the damped system continues to oscillate infinitely
(in theory), the amount of energy lost in each cycle decreases rapidly. The total energy
dissipated over all time converges to a finite value.
In engineering terms, this means that a damped system cannot release infinite energy—it
is bounded by the initial energy input. This aligns with physical intuition: once the initial
energy is dissipated through damping, the system comes to rest or settles, and no further
energy is lost.
