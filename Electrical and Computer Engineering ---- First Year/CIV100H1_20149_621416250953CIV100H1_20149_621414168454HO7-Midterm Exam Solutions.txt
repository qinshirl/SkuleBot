1. The spring of modulus k = 3.5 kN/m is loaded by a tension force of 35 N when the disc centre O is in 
the leftmost position (at x = 0). Determine the tension T required to position the disc centre at x = 150 mm. 
For that position, calculate the distance OA if the moment reaction at the fixed support at A is 60.9 Nm. 
The mass of the disc is 3 kg.

3. The pipe ACDE is supported by ball-and-socket joints at A and E and by the wire DF. Determine the 
tension in the wire when a force with a magnitude of 640N is applied at B, as shown. The weight of the 
pipe is small and can be ignored.
