Q2 [10 marks] The following circuit consists of two parts that are magnetically coupled between: (Part A) a 
solenoid (10,000 turns, radius of 4.5 cm, and  length of 20 cm) connected  to time-varying current source (IS) 
and (Part B) a coil (750 turns, radius of 4 cm) placed within the center of the solenoid. The coil is connected to 
a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) in series. Assume all circuit elements are ideal.
