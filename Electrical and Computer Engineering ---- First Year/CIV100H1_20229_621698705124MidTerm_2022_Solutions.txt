3. The vertical plane containing the utility cable turns 30º at the vertical pole OC, which is fixed at the 
base, at O. The magnitude of both tension forces, T1 and T2, is 950 N. In order to prevent long-term 
leaning of the pole, guy wires AD and BE are utilized. If the two guy wires are adjusted so as to carry 
equal tension forces, T, which together reduce the moment at O to zero, determine the magnitude of the 
horizontal reaction force at O. Also, determine the required magnitude of T. Neglect the mass of the pole.
