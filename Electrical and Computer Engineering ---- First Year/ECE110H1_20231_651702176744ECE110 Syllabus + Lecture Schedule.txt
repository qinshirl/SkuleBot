13  Land  Acknowledgement 

I (we) wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands 
of years, it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the 
Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous 
people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

Inclusivity, Accommodations and Mental Health Support 

14.1  Statement on Inclusivity 

You belong here. The University of Toronto commits to all students, faculty and staff that you can 
learn, work and create in a welcoming, respectful and inclusive environment. In this class, we 
embrace  the  broadest  range  of  people  and  encourage  their  diverse  perspectives.  This  team 
environment is how we will innovate and improve our collective academic success. You can read 
the evidence for this approach  here. 

We  expect each of us to take responsibility for the impact that our language, actions and interactions 
have on others. Engineering denounces discrimination, harassment and unwelcoming behaviour in 
all its forms. You have rights under the Ontario Human Rights Code. If you experience or witness 
any form of harassment or discrimination, including but not limited to, acts of racism, sexism, 
Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism and ageism, please tell someone 
so we can intervene. Engineering takes these reports extremely seriously. You can talk to anyone you 
feel comfortable approaching, including your professor or TA, an academic advisor, our Assistant 
Dean, Diversity, Inclusion and Professionalism, the Engineering Equity Diversity and Inclusion 
Action Group, any staff member or a U of T Equity Office. 

You are not alone. Here you can find a list of clubs and groups that support people who identify 
in many diverse ways. Working together, we can all achieve our full potential. 

14.2  Statement on Accommodations 

The University of Toronto supports accommodations for students with diverse learning needs, which 
may be associated with mental health conditions, learning disabilities, autism spectrum, ADHD, 
mobility impairments, functional/fine motor impairments, concussion or head injury, blindness 
and low vision, chronic health conditions, addictions, deafness and hearing loss, communication 
disorders and/or temporary disabilities, such as fractures and severe sprains, or recovery from an 
operation. 

If you have a learning need requiring an accommodation, the University of Toronto recommends 
that students register as soon as possible with Accessibility Services.

In  this  course,  we  do  not  have  makeup  assignments  or  tests.  However,  if  you  missed  some 
assigned tasks, some considerations may be given, as described below. It is very important to 
note that these considerations will be applicable if and only if there are legitimate reasons (e.g. 
sickness,  car  accident,…).  Student  must  submit  the  required  online  petition  with  the 
supporting documents to the First-Year Office. 

14.2.1 Missing Assignments: 
There are seven assignments in this course. All assignments run over many days. If you missed 
no more than four assignments, we will use the marks of the remaining assignments to calculate 
your  overall  assignment  grade.  If  you  missed  five  assignments,  we  will  use  the  marks  of  the 
remaining two assignments minus 20% to calculate your overall assignment grade. If you missed 
six assignments, we will use the marks of the remaining assignment minus 30% to calculate your 
overall  assignment  grade.  If  you  missed  all  seven  assignments,  you  will  receive  zero  for  the 
assignment grade. 

14.2.2 Missing Term Tests: 
There  are  two  term  tests  in  this  course.  If  you  missed  one  term  test,  we  will  use  your  final 
assessment mark to calculate your marks for the missed term test. You must keep in mind that 
the final assessment is cumulative (it includes all the materials covered in the course) and more 
substantial  than  the  term  tests.  If  you  missed  both  term  tests,  your  Final  Assessment  will  be 
worth 60% and you will be given an oral test worth 25% of the course grade. 

Important Notice: In the case of unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances such as long-term 
hospitalization, chronical heath issues or similar difficulties, which causes you to miss many of 
the course assignments and tests, please contact your course instructor and the course 
coordinator as soon as possible to discuss your situation and possible available options. 

14.3  Statement on Mental Health 

As a university student, you may experience a range of health and/or mental health challenges that 
could result in significant barriers to achieving your personal and academic goals. Please note, the 
University of Toronto and the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering offer a wide range of free 
and confidential services that could assist you during these times. 

As a U of T Engineering student, you have an Academic Advisor (undergraduate students) or a 
Graduate Administrator (graduate students) who can support you by advising on personal matters 
that impact your academics. Other resources that you may find helpful are listed on the U of T
