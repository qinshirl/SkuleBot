CIV100F/APS160F - Mechanics 

	Course	Objectives		

This course is designed to provide students with a clear and thorough demonstration of the theory and 
applications of engineering statics. Materials covered in this course are crucial to just about every 
subsequent engineering course that students will take, and every one of those courses will build off the 
knowledge gained in this course.  

The main objectives of this course are to: 

1.  Provide the students with a clear and thorough understanding of the theory and applications of 

engineering statics. A complete understanding of concepts involved in statics is absolutely critical 
to successfully becoming an engineer;  

2.  Demonstrate a good knowledge of the concepts and applications of vectors, force systems and 

moments of forces;  

3.  Provide the students with a thorough understanding of the concept, drawing and the use of free-

body diagrams, which is an essential part in solving any problem in statics;  

4.  Provide the means for developing the students’ ability to formulate equilibrium equations;  

5.  Provide the students with the means for developing good problem-solving skills; and 

6.  Enhance the students’ creativity and imagination, and systematic thinking capabilities as required 

by the engineering discipline.
