Topics covered in ECE 110

• Electrostatics, Gauss’s Law, electric potential, Capacitors and Resistors
• Magnetic Fields, and Ampere’s Law and Faraday’s Law, Inductors
• DC circuits
• First Order Circuits
• AC Circuits

Gauss’ Law

• Relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge 

enclosed by that surface.

• Key Ideas:

• Φ = ׯ 𝐸. 𝑑 Ԧ𝐴
• Both E and dA are vectors.

Gauss’ Law

Biot Savart Law

The magnitude of the field dB produced at point P 
at distance r by a current-length element ds turns 
out to be

where θ is the angle between the directions of ds and ȓ, a 
unit vector that points from ds toward P. Symbol μ0 is a 
constant, called the permeability constant, whose value is 
defined to be exactly

The direction of dB, shown as being into the page in the figure, is that of the cross 
product ds×ȓ. We can therefore write the above equation containing dB in vector form as

This vector equation and its scalar form are known as the law of Biot and Savart.

Ampere’s Law

• Can be expressed as: ׯ 𝐵. 𝑑 Ԧ𝑠 = 𝜇𝑜𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐
• Ienc is the current enclosed by the Amperian Loop

• Q: Inside a long metallic conductor, carrying a current I, where is the 

magnetic field B = 0
• A. At the center
• B. At the surface
• C. Outside
• D. Everywhere inside the conductor.

Ampere’s Law

Ampere’s law states that

The line integral in this equation is evaluated around a 
closed loop called an Amperian loop. The current i on the 
right side is the net current encircled by the loop.

Ampere’s law applied to an 
arbitrary Amperian loop that 
encircles two long straight wires 
but excludes a third wire. Note the 
directions of the currents.

Magnetic Fields of a long straight wire 
with current:

A right-hand rule for 
Ampere’s law, to 
determine the signs for 
currents encircled by an 
Amperian loop.

Magnetic Fields due to currents

magnetic field at the origin?

Faraday’s Law

• ℇ = −

𝑑Φ𝐵

where the flux is given by: Φ𝐵 = ׬ 𝐵. 𝑑 Ԧ𝐴

• The flux induced always opposes the change in the flux of B. However, 

B induced is not always opposite to B.

• Consider the loop in a constant B field with B = 4 T, which statement is 

true:

Faraday’s Law

• 𝑁𝑜𝑤 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑝 𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑡 𝑡𝑜 𝑎 𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔 𝑤𝑖𝑟𝑒:

• What is the direction of the current in the loop if it is moving parallel to the 

wire?

• What is the direction of the current in the loop if it is moving away from 

the wire?

DC circuits - Concept Questions

• The circuit has two identical light bulbs connected to a battery. What 

happens to the brightness of A and B when the switch is closed?

Concept Questions

• Which circuit generates more light?

DC Circuits

Thévenin’s and Norton’s

• Remove the load and find the open circuit voltage of the circuit
• To determine the RTH depends on the circuit

• Only independent sources. Replace voltage sources with short circuits and 

current sources with open circuits

• Only Dependent sources. Connect an independent current or voltage source 

to the terminals an calculate the voltage or current. Use Ohm’s Law to 
calculate RRH

• Both Dependent and Independent sources. Short circuit the output terminals 

and calculate isc. Use this with voc to calculate RTH.

• For Norton’s start with isc

• Express voltages, and currents as Phasors

• 𝐼 = 𝐼𝑚∠Θ𝐼
• 𝑉 = 𝑉𝑚∠Θ𝑣

• Impedance is a complex number which depends on w

• 𝑍 = 𝑍𝑚∠Θ𝑧=R+jX(w)

• For simple circuits use Ohm’s law
• Apply KVL, KCL, superposition etc
• Thevenin’s, Norton’s etc

IMPEDANCE AND ADMITTANCE

For each of the passive components the relationship between the voltage phasor 
and the current phasor is algebraic. We now generalize for an arbitrary 2-terminal
element.

(INPUT) IMPEDANCE

(DRIVING POINT IMPEDANCE)

The units of impedance are OHMS.

Impedance is NOT a phasor but a complex
number that can be written in polar or 
Cartesian form. In general, its value depends
on the frequency.
