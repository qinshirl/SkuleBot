APS 105: Computer Fundamentals – Winter 2017 Basic Course Information
Welcome! Computer software has become one of the most important engineering tools ever created. Even
in the last few years, software has become essential in almost every human endeavour, whether it is music,
design, healthcare, business or entertainment. The goal of this course to introduce you to the basics of
computer software – and using it to solve problems – and to be your ﬁrst taste of what engineering design
really is all about.

It will also to provide you with the basics for studies of software in greater depth in later courses. You
will learn how to make high-quality software through participating in lectures, but most importantly by
the work you do for the labs. The main topics to be covered are: the representation of information, the
development of good programming techniques, program organization, systematic ways of ﬁnding and
ﬁxing errors in programs, algorithms, and data structures. We will focus on the C programming language,
but the concepts taught apply to most languages.

Grading

The grade in the course will be based on ten labs, the midterm examination, and the ﬁnal examination.
The midterm examination will cover all material up to a point that will be speciﬁed in class. The ﬁnal
examination will be comprehensive, covering all material, but with the emphasis on material covered after
the midterm examination. The composition of the ﬁnal grade is as follows:

Weight
Item
25%
Labs
Midterm
25%
Final Exam 50%

The midterm examination will be held on Tuesday February 28, 2017, at 1:00pm. Calculators are not allowed
in the midterm examination, or the ﬁnal examination.

Course Web Site

The web site for this course can be found on BlackBoard, accessible from the University of Toronto Por-
tal portal.utoronto.ca. Look for the course title Computer Fundamentals. All class announcements,
and handouts - including labs, and solutions will be accessible there. We will use a different web site,
Piazza.com, to serve as a home for a course discussion board where you can ask questions about course
content and assignments.

Lab Assignments

The crucial part of this course is to learn programming by actually doing it. We provide strong TA support
in the labs to both help you, and to make sure you’re learning the key things. You will be expected to work
on your labs both on your own time, on your own computer or using the Engineering Computing Facility
computers in room SF 1012, 1013 and 1106.

There are ten labs in this course (including lab 0), and the lab schedule is given in Table 1, below. Every lab
(except Lab 0) has grades associated with it, with the earlier labs worth a smaller fraction of the lab mark,
and later labs worth more as shown in the table. It is essential to learn all of the earlier material as the later
content will be based on it!

A handout describing each assignment will be available on the course web site roughly two weeks prior
to the week in which it is due. The grade for the lab will consist of two parts - some of the grade will

be assigned by your Teaching Assistant during your speciﬁc lab period, and some of it will be done by
software that runs your program and checks its output. Each lab will be due by the end of your speciﬁc lab
period. Late submissions will receive a mark of zero.

These lab assignments will likely take a substantial amount of your time; it is important to start as early as
possible on your assignments. You are free to discuss your approach with your fellow students; however
you may not copy all or part of someone else’s assignment solution. Furthermore, under the University
of Toronto code of conduct, a person who supplies an assignment to be copied will be penalized in the
same way. We will use software to detect copying that is quite sophisticated and so is difﬁcult to defeat.

In your timetable, you have been assigned a two-hour period for working on your lab assignments. The lab
will be held in room SF1013 (and possibly SF 1012, next door) in the Sandford Fleming Building. There are
roughly 12 students to be permanently assigned to one Teaching Assistant (TA). That TA will do all of the
in-person grading for all of your labs, which will consist of marking both the style of your programs, and a
few related questions to test your understanding of the material.

In addition to your allocated lab time, you may work in the ECF labs located in SF1012, SF1013, and SF1106
when they are not booked by another group. You may also work on your assignments on your own com-
puter, but for marking purposes we will always run your programs on ECF. Always test your programs on
ECF computers before submitting them. If a program does not work on ECF, it may be considered incorrect
when the automarker checks your program with some of the test cases. No exceptions to this rule will be
made.

The total amount of marks for the labs contribute 25% to your ﬁnal grade, with earlier labs counting for
less. However, you should not skip any labs, as the later more complex labs rely on the basic knowledge
learned in the earlier ones.

Using Lab Software At Home - NetBeans

You will be using a software tool that makes it easier to develop software itself – it makes sense that software
developers have created many software tools to help in this process! We will be using the NetBeans tool,
which allows you to create and edit your software, compile it (you’ll learn what that means) and then execute

3

it. NetBeans is available on the computers in the Engineering Computing Facility that you’ll be using in
lab, and you can do all of your preparation work (prior to the lab period) on those computers.

We will also provide you with a way to run this tool on your own computer. This will be done with what
is called a ’Virtual Machine’ that runs on your laptop/computer. The ﬁrst lab will give you instructions on
how to install the needed software on your own computer.

Tutorials

You will have a single one hour tutorial associated with this course. New this year, the tutorials will be
making extensive use of the online textbook, so you will need to bring a laptop computer to the tutorials.
If you do not have a laptop, please speak with your instructor. Tutorials will begin in the week January 16,
2017.

Mandatory Plenary Lecture/Hands-On Teaching

In your schedule, you may notice that it appears to say you have a lab (PRA 010X, X=1,2,3 or 4) on Wednes-
day morning from 9am-10am, and is located in MS 2158. This is actually not a lab, but a separate special
seminar in which we will do two things: 1) Bring in guest speakers to talk about novel, interesting, and
important uses of software and 2) Insightful hands-on sessions providing a different perspective on the
software creation process for new students. The guest speakers are a way for you to understand where
software might take you; the second is to touch the real issues associated with learning software for the ﬁrst
time.
We plan to have speakers from industry and research, including the major companies (Google, Facebook)
and small startups, as well as interesting new activities in research. These lectures are mandatory, and
some of the questions on the midterm and ﬁnal will relate to topics brought by the speakers. The ﬁrst
plenary lecture will be on Wednesday January 11th from 9am-10am in the Medical Sciences Building room
2158. This room is located a little north of the Medical Sciences Building, in the south-east corner of King’s
College Circle.

Textbooks

The required textbook for this course is:

NEW this year, we are using a textbook that is quite different than previous years. This textbook is online,
and one of its great features is that you can watch programs as they execute, in a very intuitive way, and
the website itself allows you to write and run simple programs, very easily. It’s cost is $USD 63; you’ll need
a credit card to purchase it online. Note that you can also have the textbook print into a PDF, but that the
PDF will not have the interactive features.
To access this book, do the following:

1. Using your usual web browser, go to the following web address: http://zybooks.com/

2. Create an Account by Clicking on the ‘Create Account’ link on the top right of the page, and following

those instructions.

3. Once registered, click on the the ‘Take me to my Zybooks Library’ link.

4. There you will see a page that includes: ‘Are you in a class? Enter your zyBook code.’ Use this code:

UTORONTOAPS105RoseSpring2017

5. Spend 15 minutes or so learning how to move around the Zybooks website. Read Section 1.1 of the

text and click on ’Run’ for the ﬁrst program shown in that section.

You may also ﬁnd that a previous textbook used in this course is helpful (this text is not required):

An Introduction to Computer Science Using C, Second Edition
Author: John Carter
McGraw Hill Custom Publishing
ISBN 1259015262

There may be some of these available in the Engineering Stores in the basement of Sandford Fleming, and
in the University of Toronto Bookstore.

This text is also available as an e-book from McGraw Hill. The book can be viewed on a web page, or
downloaded onto any Windows or Mac Computer, or Android device, or iOS device, after installing the
appropriate application. You can purchase the e-book at University of Toronto bookstores, and by going to
this website, and clicking on the book listed as ”STG APS105 CARTER 2E EBK” for this course:

http://uoftbookstore.com/textbooks/access_codes.asp

A few notes - this site is not terribly intuitive - to purchase, just click on this book, and follow the prompts,
which will ask you to create a separate account from the main bookstore site. This will give you a code that
you need to take to another site (the publisher’s) on which you use that code. See the following website for
information on the application software that runs the e-book:

http://support.vitalsource.com

Course Discussion Board

We will be using the Piazza website for the course online discussion board. It will be monitored by instruc-
tors and TAs, but we encourage everyone to provide answers in a timely manner to each other. If you were
not already signed up to the Piazza website, please go to the following website and signup to this separate
website, as soon as possible:

https://piazza.com/utoronto.ca/winter2017/aps105/home

If you would like clariﬁcations or explanations of laboratory assignments, do not wait until your scheduled
lab section. You should ﬁrst check the course discussion board on the Piazza web site – someone else
may have asked the same question already. Fellow students may also help you out by replying to your
questions. Even if you do not have a question about a lab, it is a good idea to look at the course discussion
board from time to time. You may see a question or a response there that will make you realize that there is
some feature of the lab that you had never considered.
If you are considering posting a question to the discussion board, you should do two things before doing so.
First, try to read the current entries to see if your question has already been asked and answered. Second,
you should make sure that your question is as clear as you can make it.

Petitions and Re-marking Requests

If you miss a lab assignment, or the midterm examination for a valid reason, you need to submit a petition
to the ﬁrst year ofﬁce, which will then be sent to your instructor. The petition should be sent to the ﬁrst
year ofﬁce within 5 days of the event, and include documentation.

If you believe that your lab assignments or midterm examination were not marked correctly, you need to
submit a re-marking request form within two weeks, with detailed reasons in writing. The re-marking
request form is downloadable from the course web site.

Academic Integrity

In developing solutions to labs, you may wish to discuss your approach to the solution with fellow students.
This is ﬁne as long as the ﬁnal solution is yours alone. If you discuss some aspect of a lab with another
student, neither of you should take any notes. You should never copy your lab solutions or let another
student copy yours, not even a portion of them. You should not post any of your assignment questions in
a private or public online discussion forum or web site in order to solicit solutions from others. You should
not allow any other student to read any portions of your solution, either by sharing a computer screen, or
by sharing portions of the code remotely via instant messaging or social networking web sites. Note that,
under the University of Toronto code of conduct, a person who supplies an assignment to be copied will
be penalized in the same way. We will use software to detect copying that is quite sophisticated and so is
difﬁcult to defeat.

e-mail

Please make sure that you check your University of Toronto mail account on a daily basis. You are required
to read your email messages that are sent to you at your University of Toronto email address as it may
contain important announcements from the First Year Ofﬁce or the ECE Undergraduate Ofﬁce.

Getting Help

Although you may never have needed extra help in school before, you may well ﬁnd that you need assis-
tance in this course. Even if you have heard that it is hard to ﬁnd help at university, the truth is that help is
readily available in a number of forums.

• Tutorials

During the tutorials this year, we will be making use of the online textbook, to reinforce concepts
taught in class by directly working with the. You should bring your laptop computer to the class. If
you do not have a laptop computer, please inform your instructor.

• Ofﬁce Hours

As noted earlier, your instructor is available for extra help during regular ofﬁce hours. To get help
from your instructor, either visit his/her ofﬁce during a scheduled ofﬁce hour, or, if that is not conve-
nient, speak to them after class, or send an email to set up an appointment.

Accessibility Needs

The University of Toronto is committed to accessibility. If you require accommodations or have any acces-
sibility concerns, please visit http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as as soon as possible.
