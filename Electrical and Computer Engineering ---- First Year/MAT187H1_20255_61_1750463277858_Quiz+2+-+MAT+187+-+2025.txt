Instructions
• This is a Type A assessment and does not allow any external aids.
• Read all instructions carefully and justify all your answers. No points will be awarded for a correct

answer without justification.

• Read each question carefully. No clarification or content related questions will be answered.

You may use the following space for scratch work or to continue your solutions if you run out of room. If
you do so, please clearly indicate in the original question that part of your solution appears here.

1. (4 points) Consider the improper integral:

ˆ

∞

−∞

1
(x + 1)

dx

Define what it means for this improper integral to converge or diverge. You do not need to evaluate
the integral—just explain the definition.

Solution: This integrand has vertical asymptotes at x = −1, so the function is not continuous
on the interval (−∞, ∞). Additionally, the interval of integration is infinite.

To evaluate the convergence of this integral, we must break it into parts at the discontinuities and
use limits. The integral is defined as:
ˆ

ˆ

ˆ

∞

−∞

1
(x + 1)

dx = lim

b→1−

d→∞

1

(x + 1)

dx

The integral converges only if all four limits exist and are finite. If any one of these limits
does not exist or is infinite, the integral is said to diverge. Note that we do not need to split the
integrals at x = −2 and x = 0, any points above and below x = −1 will work.

2. (3 points) True or False: If f (x) ≤ g(x) for all x ≥ 1, and

´
∞
1 f (x) dx also converges. Justify your answer.

´

∞
1 g(x) dx converges, then it implies that

Solution: False. The statement is not always true without an additional assumption.

The comparison test requires that both functions be nonnegative on the interval. If f (x) ≤
g(x), but f (x) takes on negative values, the conclusion about convergence may not hold.
Counterexample: Let g(x) = 1

x2 , which is positive and
ˆ

ˆ

∞

g(x) dx =

x2 dx

converges.

Now let f (x) = −1, which satisfies f (x) ≤ g(x) for all x ≥ 1, but

ˆ

ˆ

f (x) dx =

diverges to −∞. So, the original statement is false.

3. (3 points) Consider the improper integral:

ˆ

∞

1

1
xp dx

For which values of p > 0 does this integral converge? (No justification necessary.) Explain in words
why the integral converges for some values of p and diverges for others, even though 1
xp → 0 as x → ∞
for all p > 0.

Solution: The integral

ˆ

∞

1

1
xp dx

converges if p > 1 and diverges if p ≤ 1. This is often referred to as the p-test.
Even though 1
determines whether the total area under the curve is finite.

xp → 0 as x → ∞ for all p > 0, the rate at which the function approaches zero

When p ≤ 1, the function decays too slowly — the “tail” of the function is thick enough that the
area accumulates without bound, causing the integral to diverge.

When p > 1, the function decays quickly enough that the area under the curve from 1 to ∞ is
finite, and so the integral converges.

4. (6 points) Evaluate the integral or show it diverges:

ˆ

∞

0

xe−x dx

Solution: This is an improper integral due to the infinite upper limit. We evaluate it as a limit:

ˆ

∞

0

xe−x dx = lim
t→∞

ˆ

t

0

xe−x dx

We compute the definite integral using integration by parts: Let

u = x ⇒ du = dx,

dv = e−xdx ⇒ v = −e−x

Then:

ˆ

ˆ

xe−x dx = −xe−x +

e−x dx = −xe−x − e−x + C = −(x + 1)e−x + C

Now apply the limits:

ˆ

t

0

xe−x dx = (cid:2)−(x + 1)e−x(cid:3)t

0

= −(t + 1)e−t + (0 + 1)e0
= −(t + 1)e−t + 1

Now take the limit as t → ∞:

(cid:2)−(t + 1)e−t + 1(cid:3) = 1

lim
t→∞

Final Answer: The integral converges and equals 1 .

5. (6 points) Determine whether the following improper integral converges or diverges. Justify your

answer using the comparison test:

Solution: As x → 0+,

√

x ≫ x2, so:

ˆ

x + x2

dx

√
x

Thus we attempt to compare the integrand with 1√

x to show convergence.

Firstly note that 0 ≤ 1√

x+x2 , so we can apply the comparison test.

For 0 < x < 1, we have:

√

x + x2 >

x ⇒ 0 ≤

Now,

Therefore by the comparison test,

6. (8 points) According to Coulomb’s law, the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point

charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by:

F (r) =

kq1q2
r2

where k is a positive constant.

The work required to move a particle from position x = r1 to x = r2 with a force F (x) is given by:
ˆ

r2

Work =

F (x) dx

r1

Assuming both charges have the same sign (i.e., they repel each other), explain whether it is physically
possible to bring the two charges to a distance of zero.

Solution: If the two charges have the same sign, they repel each other. To bring them closer
together, an external agent must apply a force opposing this repulsion. The amount of work
required is given by:

r1
Since q1 and q2 are both positive (or both negative), kq1q2 > 0, so the force is repulsive and points
away from the other charge. To bring the charges together, we must integrate from r1 > 0 to
r2 = 0, which gives:
ˆ

Work =

ˆ

r2

kq1q2
x2 dx

Work =

0

kq1q2
x2 dx

r1
This is an improper integral because the integrand has a vertical asymptote at x = 0 and by the
p-test, this integral diverges.

Therefore, the work required to bring the charges to a distance of zero is infinite. This means that,
in practice, it is physically impossible to bring two like charges all the way to r = 0, because it
would require an infinite amount of energy.
