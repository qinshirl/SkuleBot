Question 1 [2 Marks] 

Find and correct all compile-time errors (mistakes that would cause compilation or that would 
cause the 'build' to  fail) in the following C program. Your answer should both identify what the 
error is, and what the correction should be. Marks will be deducted if you identify correct items 
as compile-time errors. 

#include <stdio.h> 
mt main (void) 
mt  j,  k; 
mt  *1 =

Question 4 [2 Marks] 
In a doubly linked list, each node has two pointers: one called next which points to the next node 
in the list, and one called prey which points to the previous node in the list, as in the following 
declaration: 

struct node 
mt key; 
struct node *next; 
struct node *prev; 
*n, *p; 

Consider a part of a doubly linked list as shown below where the two variables, n and p, have 
been set to point to nodes as shown in the figure: 

N 

Which of the following expression(s) does not refer (point) to the third, right-most node in the 
diagram above? 

p->next 

n->next->next 

p->next->prev 

n->next->prev->next->next 

p->next-->prev-->next

Question 5 [2 Marks] 
Consider the following array with exactly 15 elements: 

Suppose we are doing a binary search on the array. 

Circle all elements that would not be found after examining three numbers if we were searching 
for the value of the target element using binary search. (An element is considered "examined" if 
it is compared against the value being searched for.)

Question 7 [2 Marks] 
There have been four plenary lectures since the midterm in this course, and there is one question 
from each of these lectures below. You must answer two of these four questions. Each answer 
should be one or two sentences. If you answer more than two questions, you must indicate which 
two you wish to be graded; if you do not indicate which, then the first two in order will be graded. 

Plenary Lecture 6 - From Circuits to Software (Professor Jason Anderson) 
Professor Anderson described methods of converting computations (that are described in soft-
ware) into hardware that could perform that same computation. For example, an addition in 
software (such as a  =  b  + C;) would be converted into a hardware adder. Similarly multiplica-
tion and division are converted into multipliers and dividers. He also described a key step in the 
overall process of conversion, which was called scheduling. What is the purpose of the scheduling 
step? 

Plenary Lecture 7— Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (Xavier Snelgrove) 
Mr. Snelgrove described two methods for having a computer try to understand human language. 
The first method used 'if' statements, like those used in this course, to identify specific words and 
phrases that are present in the words written. What is the problem with this method, and what 
better method did he describe for performing this function? 

7 

Plenary Lecture 8— Computer Vision (Professor Sven Dickinson) 
Professor Dickinson described many possible applications that use computer vision methods. Name 
two of them. 

Plenary Lecture 9— Accenture (Safdar Mahmood) 
Mr. Mahmood described the notion of 'disruption' in the modern, business context. What does 
the word disruption mean in that context? 

Rl 

Question 8 [8 Marks] 
Write a C language function called rotateAndFindLongest that does two things: 

It rotates the values of four integer variables that exist in the calling function. For example, if 
the value of the four variables in the calling function were 34, 28, 66, 19 before the function 
was called, the variable values would be 19, 34, 28, 66 after the function was called. 

The function should return .the value of the largest of the all four variables. 

Answer.

Question 9 [7 Marks] 
This question has several, somewhat related, parts: 

(a) Write the C-language code to declare four variables with the following types. You can freely 
choose the name of your variables. 

A 32 bit signed integer 

A double 

A char 

An array of bool of size 10 

Answer. 

(b) Write the complete C-language code that declares a struct, called myStruct, that contains all 
four of the types from part (a) as members. 

Answer. 

10 

Write the C-language code for a new version of the struct in part (b), called myLLStruct, that 

would enable it to be used as a node in a linked list. 

Answer: 

Write a single C statement to declare an array (called myArrayStruct) of size 100 of the struct 

declared in part (b) - i.e of the struct myStruct. 

Answer. 

Write several lines of C-language code that will initialize the first 50 integers in the above array 
(from part (d)) to the value 1000, and the last 50 doubles to be 0.5, and every booleari value in the 
array to be false. All other values in the array should not be initialized. 

Answer: 

11 

Question 10 [8 Marks] 

You are to write a function that sets a rectangular portion of a 2-dimensional array to a specific 
value. The function takes the following as input parameters: an integer 1000x1000 2-dimensional 
array called A, four integer parameters named rowStart, rowErid, oolltart, and colEnd 
and an integer parameter value. 

The purpose of the function is to set the value of the array elements in A beginning with 
A[rowStart] [colSt art ] and ending with MrowEnd] [colEnd] to be the value value. The 
picture below illustrates that the shaded portion of the array should have its elements changed to 
value, for the specific example given: 

rowStart = 2, rowEnd =6, coiStart = 3, colEnd = 8 

A[2][3] 

A[6][8] 

However, this function is to he used by students in a first year C programming course, and those 
students are well-known for writing code that has errors. For example, they often attempt to 
access elements of an array outside of its defined bounds, among other problems. Therefore, 
your function should check that the inputs to the function are correct before performing the above 
operation. You must determine, through the reading of this question, what would make the inputs 
rowStart, rowEnd, colStart, colEnd and value correct. (You can assume that the array 
A is passed in correctly.) 

The function should return a hoolean result that is set to true if the inputs are valid, and false if 
they are not. In the case that the inputs are not valid, the setting of the values of the array should 
not he attempted. 

IMPORTANT: Your solution, in addition to the code for the function described above, should 
also show how you would call this function from the main function, and make use of its return 
value. That is, you should show the call to the function (with appropriately declared variables, 
and gathering input from the user for rowStart, rowEnd, colloart, colEiid and value) 
and make appropriate use of the returned boolean value.

Question 11 [10 Marks] 
Write a function char *delete SubSt ring (char *source, char *substring) thattakes 
two strings called source and substring as its parameters. It should return a new dynamically 
allocated string that is constructed from the strings source and substring. The newly created 
and returned string should be the same as the source string, but with the first occurrence of the 
string substring removed. For example, if the string source has the value "my toronto", 
and the string substring has the value "to", the function will return the string "my ronto". 
You may use any of the string-related functions in the C standard library, and may assume that 
string. h has been included.

Question 12 [10 Marks] 
Recall that, in a binary tree, a node that has no children is called a leaf.  Given the following node 
declaration: 

struct treeNode 
mt  value; 
struct treeNode *left; 
struct treeNode *right; 

}; 

write  function called t re e Le a f C ou n t () that takes one struct treeNode *root parameter 
and returns the number of leaves in the tree pointed to by root. You may not use global variables 
in your solution.

Question 13 [10 Marks] 
QuickSort is considered one of the fastest sorting algorithms in practice. However, it turns out that 
Insertion Sort is faster than QuickSort for smaller arrays; e.g., for arrays with 10 or fewer elements. 
Because of this, many implementations use a combination of both algorithms: they use QuickSort 
when the size of the array segment to be sorted is larger than 10, but switch over to Insertion Sort 
when the size of the array segment to be sorted is less than or equal to 10. 

switches over to 
Your job is to implement QuickSort for an array of doubles that at 
Insertion Sort for the small array segments with less than or equal to 10 elements. To make yoi 
job easier, you can assume the following function is available: 

mt  selectPivotAndpartition (double list[],  mt  from, mt  to); 

This function processes the segment of array a from index from to index to. It selects a pivot in a 
smart way, and then partitions all elements in the [from, to] segment so that all elements less 
than or equal to pivot are located to the left of the pivot element and all elements greater than or 
equal to pivot are located to the right of the pivot element. The function then returns the index of 
the array where the pivot is located. Hence, after you call 

mt  pindex =  selectpivotAndPartition(list, from, to); 

you are guaranteed that 

list [i]  <=  list[pindex] when from < i  <  pindex 

and 

list[i] >=  list [pindex] when pindex < i < to

Question 14 [10 Marks] 
The following C structure is used to define each node in a linked list: 

typedef struct node 

mt data; 
struct *link; 

Node.- 

Write a C function, called buildJoinedList, that takes two linked lists called firstList and 
secondList as its parameters, and returns a new list that joins the two lists, with secondList 
at the front. Both firstList and secondList are pointers to the first node of a linked list. The 
function should return a pointer to a new list that is dynamically allocated. 

Note that the existing linked lists pointed to by firstList and secondList must not be mod-
ified in any way. 

An example of how the function should work is as follows: if f i r s t L i s t points to a linked list 
containing nodes storing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and secondList containing the num-
bers 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, then the newly created list returned by the buiidJoinedList function 
should contain nodes storing the numbers 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
