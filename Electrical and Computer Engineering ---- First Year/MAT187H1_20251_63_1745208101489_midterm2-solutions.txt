F (x) exist? Provide a well-written justification.

Justification: Notice that x2 + x − 6 ≥ x2 when x ≥ 6. Therefore

0 < f (x) ≤

when x ≥ 6. Since F is an antiderivative of f (and because f is continuous on [6, ∞)), we know

f (t) dt = F (x) + C

f (t) dt ≤ lim

(cid:90) x

t2 dt < ∞

with the last inequality following from the p-test. Because f (x) is positive on [0, ∞), by monotone

convergence,

f (t) dt converges and therefore lim
x→∞

F (x) converges.

4. In this question, you are asked to draw, if possible, the graph of a function f : [0, 2] → R subject to

various restrictions. If no such function exists, you are to mark the option “No such f exists”.

For both questions, you are to assume:

• f is continuous
• f is defined on its entire domain [0, 2]
• f (0) = 0

Note 1: in the following questions you are drawing f but integrating 1/f .

Note 2: if you feel like your drawing is unclear, you may add a description in words below your graph.

n2nxn. He is searching for the radius of convergence of

P . His writeup for his instructor is as follows:

n=0

Dear Instructor, I applied the ratio test to find radius of convergence of P (x).

(Step 1) First, I compute the limit

(Step 2) Simplifying, I get

L = lim
n→∞

(n + 1)2n+1xn+1

.

L = lim

(n + 1)2x

(Step 3) Since 2x is a constant, I may pull it out of the limit and so we see

L = lim
n→∞

n + 1
n

· 2x = 2x · lim
n→∞

n + 1

= 2x · 1 = 2x.

(Step 4) The ratio test requires L < 1. I see

L = 2x < 1

=⇒

x <

.

(Step 5) Therefore P (x) converges when x ∈ (−∞, 1
(Step 6) Therefore the radius of convergence of P (x) is ∞.

correct or not.

made no mistakes, mark “Shiwei’s answer has no mistakes”.

(Step 1)

First, I compute the limit

L = lim

(Step 2)

Simplifying, I get

L = lim

(Step 3)

Since | 2x |

· | 2x | = | 2x | · lim

(Step 4)

The ratio test requires L < 1. I see

L = | 2x | < 1

=⇒

| x | <

.

Therefore P (x) converges when (cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:24)(cid:58) x ∈ (−1/2, 1/2)

x ∈ (−∞, 1

(Step 5)

(Step 6)

Therefore the radius of convergence of P (x) is (cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:42)

tall and looks roughly like a cone.

Because of the way the chemicals in the battery settle, the energy density of a fully charged battery varies
as a function of height. Let D(h) be the energy density at height h metres above the base of a fully
