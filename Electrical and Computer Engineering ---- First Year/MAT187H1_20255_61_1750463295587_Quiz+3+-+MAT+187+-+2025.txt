Instructions
• This is a Type A assessment and does not allow any external aids.
• Read all instructions carefully and justify all your answers. No points will be awarded for a correct

answer without justification.

• Read each question carefully. No clarification or content related questions will be answered.

You may use the following space for scratch work or to continue your solutions if you run out of room. If
you do so, please clearly indicate in the original question that part of your solution appears here.

1. (3 points) Give an example of a non-constant function for which the trapezoidal rule gives the exact
value of the definite integral over an interval. Explain why this happens. Use a sketch to justify your
answer.

Solution:
The trapezoidal rule gives the exact value of a definite integral
for any linear function:

f (x)

f (x) = mx + b

on any interval [a, b], regardless of how many subintervals are
used.
This is because the trapezoidal rule approximates the area under
a curve by connecting points with straight line segments. For a
linear function, this exactly matches the graph. Since the graph
is composed of straight lines, each trapezoid perfectly fills the
area under the curve with no error.

2. (3 points) A student approximates the integral

zoidal rule with the same number of subintervals and finds:

1
0 f (x) dx using both the midpoint rule and the trape-

Mn = 1.83 and Tn = 2.17

Assuming no inflection points on the interval [0, 1], what can you conclude about the concavity of
f (x)? Justify your answer.

Solution: The trapezoidal rule overestimates the integral if the function is concave up, and the
midpoint rule underestimates it in that case.

Here, Mn < Tn, which suggests:

Midpoint estimate < Actual value < Trapezoidal estimate

Since there is no inflection points in the interval where the concavity changes, this implies the
function is concave up on the interval.

3. (3 points) The second-degree Taylor polynomial for a function f , centered at x = 1, is given by:
P2(x) = 5 + 2(x − 1) − 3(x − 1)2. Based on this polynomial, describe the local behaviour of f (x)
near x = 1. Is the function increasing or decreasing? Is it concave up or concave down? Justify your
reasoning.

Solution: The second-degree Taylor polynomial is:

P2(x) = f (1) + f ′(1)(x − 1) +

f ′′(1)
2

(x − 1)2 = 5 + 2(x − 1) − 3(x − 1)2

So we can read off the derivatives:

• f ′(1) = 2: the function is increasing at x = 1.

• f ′′(1)

2 = −3 ⇒ f ′′(1) = −6: the function is concave down near x = 1.

Conclusion: Near x = 1, the function is increasing and concave down.

´

0 ln(x + 1) dx using the midpoint rule with an error less

than 1

100. How many subintervals n are needed to guarantee this accuracy?

Hint: Use the midpoint rule error bound:

|EM | ≤

(b − a)3
24n2

· max
a≤x≤b

|f ′′(x)|

Solution: We are given f (x) = ln(x + 1). Compute the second derivative:

f ′(x) =

1
x + 1

,

f ′′(x) = −

1
(x + 1)2

So on [0, 2], |f ′′(x)| = 1

(x+1)2 , which is largest when x = 0:

max |f ′′(x)| =

12 = 1

Now apply the midpoint error bound:

|EM | ≤

We want:

Since 52 = 25 < 33.3 and 62 = 36 > 33.3, the smallest integer n is:

n = 6

(b) (3 points) Based on the data, explain why Simpson’s Rule is a good choice here compared to

other basic numerical methods.

Solution: The function values decrease steadily and appear to follow a smooth, nonlinear
trend, possibly exponential decay. Since Simpson’s Rule fits a quadratic polynomial across
each pair of subintervals, it generally gives more accurate results for smooth, curved data than
trapezoidal or midpoint rules.
Because the data is evenly spaced and relatively smooth, Simpson’s Rule is well-suited here.
It captures the curvature of the function more accurately than linear approximations would.
However, if the actual function changes more sharply between points or is not well-approximated
by quadratics, some error may still occur.

arises when modeling light intensity near the edge of a diffraction pattern. This integral has no
elementary antiderivative, so we must rely on approximations.
