5. A tank is full of water. The tank is a square-based pyramid oriented with the tip of the pyramid 

pointing upward. Each side of the base of the pyramid is 4 m long, and the pyramid is 8 in tall. How 

much work is required to empty the tank by pumping all the water up to a height 1 m above the top 

of the tank? (Assume the density of water is p and that the acceleration due to gravity is g; leave 

your answer in terms of p and g.)
