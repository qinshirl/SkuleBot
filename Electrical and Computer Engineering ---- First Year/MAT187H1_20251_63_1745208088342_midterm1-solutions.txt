3. Tiffany is an artist. She loves painting cannon balls. Her idea for a new painting involves drawing the
path of a cannon ball in flight and filling in the area between the bottom of the canvas and the arc of
the cannon ball with gold leaf (an expensive alternative to paint).

Since gold leaf is expensive, she wants to purchase exactly what she needs. To get an estimate, Tiffany
has found a polynomial interpolation for the cannon ball’s path (as traced out on the canvas).
Let f (x) represent the height of the cannon ball’s path on the canvas in metres at a horizontal distance
of x metres from the lower left corner of the canvas. Let

P (x) = −x2 + x + 2

be a quadratic approximation of f .

For this question, you have the following information:

• The canvas is 2m wide and 3m tall.
• |f (x) − P (x)| ≤ 1

6 for x ∈ [0, 2].

(a) (2 points) Using the available information, give the best possible upper bound for the number of

square metres of gold leaf that Tiffany needs to buy.

Amount of gold leaf required ≤

11/3m2 ≈ 3.66m2

(b) (2 points) Using the available information, give the best possible lower bound for the number of

square metres of gold leaf that Tiffany needs to buy.

Amount of gold leaf required ≥

4. A snail is climbing up a wall that is 10m tall. The snail starts crawling up the wall at a speed of 5m/h.

Every hour, the snail gets distracted and its speed instantaneously decreases by half.
Let Hn be the height of the front of the snail’s body after n hours of climbing. For n ≥ 3, let Wn be the
part of that distance travelled by the snail, starting from exactly three hours after it began its climb. For
example, W5 is the distance traveled by the snail between the end of hour 3 and the end of hour 5.

(c) (2 points) Assume n ≥ 3. Express Wn in terms of Hn (i.e., your formula must involve Hn and cannot

use sigma notation).

Wn =

Hn − H3

(d) (2 points) The snail’s antennae stick out 1cm in front of its body. Will the snail ever touch the

ceiling? Provide a well-written justification.

The snail will touch the ceiling (cid:13) The snail won’t touch the ceiling

Justification:

If the snail’s body reaches within 1cm of the ceiling, it will touch the ceiling. This will happen if
Hn ≥ 9.99 for some n. Using the Geometric sum formula, we see

Hn = 5

1 − (1/2)n
1 − 1/2

= 10(1 − (1/2)n).

From this formula we see limn→∞ Hn = 10 and so eventually Hn ≥ 9.99. (In fact H7 > 9.99.)

6. The function f has a Taylor series representation centered at a = 2 of

T (x) = 1 + 2(x − 2) + 3(x − 2)2 + 4(x − 2)3 + 5(x − 2)4 + · · · .

(b) (3 points) Does T (x) converge when x = 3? Provide a well-written justification.

(cid:13) Converges

Does not converge

Justification:
The series at x = 3 is T (3) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + · · · , with partial sums (cid:80)n
are bounded below by n, and so they diverge, which means T (3) diverges.

i=0 i. These partial sums

(c) (3 points) Does T (x) converge when x = 2? Provide a well-written justification.

Converges (cid:13) Does not converge

Justification:

The series at x = 2 is T (2) = 1 + 0 + 0 + · · · = 1, and so it is convergent.

i. (2 points) Write down an expression for T3(x). (No need to simplify/expand your expression.)

T3(x) =

ii. (4 points) Give an upper bound for |f (2.2) − T3(2.2)|. Provide a well-written justification.

Note 1: There is no need to simplify your upper bound.
Note 2: If you need to do scratch work, do so on the blank pages of the test. Only write your
final, polished answer in the box.

|f (2.2) − T3(2.2)| ≤

500

4! (0.2)4 ≈ 0.033

Justification:
By Taylor’s remainder theorem, T3(x) − f (x) = f (4)(c)
graph we can see |f (4)(c)| ≤ 500 when c ∈ [2, 2.2]. So, we get a bound of

4!

7. A very fast snail is heading straight towards you. Its distance from you at time t in seconds is given by
B(t) in metres. At time 0, the snail is 4 metres away from you travelling towards you at a speed of 3m/s
and slowing down at a rate of 1m/s2. Further suppose that B(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) < 0 and that all 4th derivatives and
up are negligible (i.e., close to zero).
(a) (2 points) Give a formula for T2, the 2nd Taylor approximation to B(t) centered at t = 0.

T2(t) =

4 − 3t + t2
2

(b) (2 points) Given the information above, what is your best estimate for when the snail will hit you?

t =

2

(c) (3 points) Is your estimate from the previous part an underestimate or an overestimate? Provide a

well written justification.
(cid:13) Underestimate

Overestimate

Justification:
Since B(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) < 0, we know that T3(t) = 4 − 3t + t2
term, T3 is decreasing faster than T2, so T2 provides an overestimate.

2 − αt3 for some α > 0. With this higher order
