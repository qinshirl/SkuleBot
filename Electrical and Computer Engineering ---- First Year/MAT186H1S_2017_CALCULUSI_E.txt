2. Tougher questions, now that you are ready: 
a) Two cats were standing together when a sudden noise scared them away. 
The smaller cat ran at 2 km/hr and the larger one ran twice as fast. If 
the cats ran in straight lines, 45° apart, how fast was the distance 
between them increasing after two hours? 

Note: I know cats won't run in a straight line, much less do anything other than 
sleep for two hours at a stretch, but we'll pretend these ones do.

b) Find the equation of the tangent line to y = (x2  - 3)2x+1 at x = 2.

5.  A tall house has a fence 3m tall standing 2m away from it. If we set a ladder on the 
neighbouring lawn in order to reach the house (that is, the ladder goes from the 
yard, over the fence, and touches the house), what is the minimum length of 
ladder needed?

6. (a) Let R be the region bounded between y  = x2  and y = 2x + 3. Find 

the area of R. 

[4 marks] 

(b) Find the volume of the solid created if R is rotated about x = 4.

(c) The solid created in (b) cannot actually hold any liquid past the point where 
the line y  = 2x + 3 creates a boundary. Therefore, there is only a 
donut-shaped tray that can be filled. How much work is required to fill 
it with liquid pumped up from the height of the x - axis?
