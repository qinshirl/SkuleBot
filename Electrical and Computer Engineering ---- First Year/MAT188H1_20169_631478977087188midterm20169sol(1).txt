(D) (ii) and (iii) only
(E) (i) and (ii) only

Answer: A
Solution:
i) This matrix is not in row-echelon form as there is a leading one in each row but each leading 1 is not to the right of the

one above it.

ii) This matrix is in row echelon form.
iii) This matrix is not in row-echelon form as there is a row full of 0’s that is not at the bottom of the matrix.

2. Let x, y, z be non-zero vectors in R3. Which of the following statements are TRUE?

(i) If x × y = x × z then y = z.

(ii) (x × y) × z = x × (y × z).

(iii) ||x × y|| = 0 if and only if x and y are parallel.

(A) (ii) only
(B) (iii) only
(C) (i) and (iii) only

iii) This is true. We know that ||x × y|| = ||x||||y|| sin θ where θ is the angle between x and y. This being equal to 0 would
imply that either x or y is the zero vector (in which case they are parallel as one is a multiple of another), or the sine of the
angle between them is 0, meaning that angle is either 0 or π, meaning that one of the vectors is a (possible negative) multiple
of another.

linearly dependent?

(A) c = 0
(B) c = −1
(C) c = 2
(D) (A) and (B) only
(E) (B) and (C) only

Answer: E
Solution:
For a set of 2 vectors to be linearly dependent, one must be a scalar multiple of the other.

(cid:20)0

(cid:21)

A) This value of c does not work. When c = 0, the vectors are

which are clearly not scalar multiples. Thus, the

vectors are linearly independent.

B) This value of c works. When c = −1, the vectors are

(cid:21)
(cid:20)−1
1

and

(cid:21)

(cid:20) 1

and one vector is -1 times the other. Thus, the

vectors are linearly dependent.

For each question, choose the BEST option from the given options.

4. Let x, y, z be vectors in R3. Which of the following statements are TRUE?

(i) If the set S = {x, y, z} is linearly independent, then the set {x, y} is linearly independent.

(ii) If the set S = {x, y, z} is linearly dependent, then the set {x, y} is linearly dependent.

(iii) If the three sets {x, y}, {y, z}, and {x, z} are linearly independent, then the set S = {x, y, z} is linearly independent.

(A) (i) only
(B) (ii) only
(C) (iii) only
(D) (i) and (ii) only
(E) (i) and (iii) only

Answer: A
Solution:
i) This is true.
Notice that if the set {x, y} is linearly dependent then it is possible to form the zero vector using a non-trivial combination
of x and y. The zero vector can still be formed by the same linear combination of x and y with z taken with a coeﬃcient of 0
which would mean that S is linearly dependent too.

ii) This is false. As a counterexample, we can take x = z =

as x − z = 0. But {x, y} is linearly independent as x and y are not scalar multiples.

iii) This is false. As a counterexample, we can take x =

and {x, z} are linearly independent since no two x, y, z are scalar multiples of each other, but {x, y, z} is linearly dependent as
x + y − z = 0.

(B) inﬁnitely many solutions with two parameters
(C) inﬁnitely many solutions with one parameter

(E) no solutions

Answer: C
Solution:
We interpret this matrix as the augmented matrix of the system

x1 + x2 + x4 = 1
x3 + x4 = 1
x4 = 0

We see that x2 is the only free variable which as assigned as a parameter in the general solution. Hence, there are inﬁnitely
many solutions with one parameter.

Part II - Short Answer Questions. Write your solutions in the space provided below each question.

1. Let P be the plane 2x1 + x3 = 3.

(a) Find parametric equations of the line L that contains the point (−1, 6, 0) and is orthogonal to P. [2 marks]

Answer:

for any t ∈ R.

Solution:

x1 = −1 + 2t
x2 = 6
x3 = t

Since the equation for P is 2x1 + 0x2 + 1x3 = 3, then the vector




 is normal to the plane. Thus, any line with

direction vector will be orthogonal to the plane. Since we are given the point that the line must contain, we can write the vector

Let Q be the point (−1, 6, 0). Take any point P on the plane. For simplicity we choose P to be (0, 0, 3). Then, the shortest

Answer: Yes.
Solution:

We start by ﬁnding the normal vector n to the plane. We know that n = ( (cid:126)P Q) × ( (cid:126)P R) =

which indeed passes through the origin since −10(0) + 6(0) + 8(0) = 0.

6. Is it possible to ﬁnd a 2 × 2 matrix whose rows are linearly independent but whose columns are linearly dependent? Prove
your answer. [5 marks]

Answer: No.
Solution:

We suppose such a matrix exists and arrive at a contradiction. Call this matrix A =

(cid:20)a b
d
c

(cid:21)
.

Case 1: None of the entries in the matrix are 0. Since the columns are linearly dependent, we get that b = ka and d = kc,

for some scalar k. Our matrix is then

(cid:20) a ka
kc
c

(cid:21)

.

We notice that the rows of this matrix is linearly dependent as the second row is equal to c

a times the ﬁrst row. Thus, it is

not possible to ﬁnd such a matrix in this case. Notice, however, that the above argument does not hold if a = 0!

Case 2: If a = 0, then A =

(cid:21)

(cid:20)0
b
c d

. Since the columns are linearly dependent, it must be that b = 0 too. Hence, A =

(cid:20)0
0
c d

(cid:21)
.

But then the rows are linearly dependent too since the ﬁrst row is 0 times the second.
