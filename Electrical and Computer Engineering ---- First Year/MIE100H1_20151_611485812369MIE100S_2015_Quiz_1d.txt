At time t = 0, a particle is at (x, y) = (-3, 8) meters, and has a velocity of 4
to 2

 m/s2.  

 + 3

 – 3

 m/s. Its acceleration is constant, equal 

(a)  At t = 0, find the normal component of the acceleration. Will this answer change with time? (yes or no).

(b) At time t = 0, express the unit vector ûθ, and find the angle that ûθ makes relative to the x-axis. 
(c)  Find the magnitude of the position vector (
x = xo + vot  +  ½ aot2 ;          

 = v û t + vθ û n = v û t + v2/ρ û n ;     

v = vo + aot ;               

) at t = 3 seconds.
