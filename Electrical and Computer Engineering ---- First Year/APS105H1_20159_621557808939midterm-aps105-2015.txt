Question 1 [2 Marks]
In the following C program, how many times will the letter D be printed?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
int i = 300;

while (i > 0) {

if (i % 2 == 0)
printf("D");

i--;

}

return (EXIT_SUCCESS);

}

Question 2 [2 Marks]
Given that averageSpeed is a double type variable that contains a value representing a car’s av-
erage speed in metres/second for the past 30 minutes, write a single C statement that declares and
initializes a double type variable called distance. The variable distance should be initialized
to represent the distance travelled by the car in kilometres for the past 30 minutes.

2

Question 3 [2 Marks]
Write a single C statement that declares an int variable randomGuess, and initializes it with
a randomly generated odd number between LOWER_BOUND and UPPER_BOUND (inclusive). As-
sume that LOWER_BOUND and UPPER_BOUND are odd numbers declared as integer constants, and
UPPER_BOUND is the larger value of the two.

Question 4 [2 Marks]
In a C program, three bool-type variables have been declared, with the names red, green and
blue, and are initialized to either true or false. Write a single C statement that declares and
initializes a bool-type variable called yellow that is set to true when both the red and green
variables are true, but the blue variable is false.

Question 5 [2 Marks]
The variable numApples is an int type variable representing the number of apples in a barrel.
The owner of the apples is deciding whether to sell them in packages of 3 or 5 apples. Write a
single C statement that declares and initializes an int type variable called leftover. leftover
should be initialized to the minimum of two quantities: 1) the number of apples left over when
the barrel of apples is packaged into groups of 3; 2) the number of apples left over when the barrel
of apples is packaged into groups of 5. Hint: Use a function in the math library.

Question 6 [2 Marks]

The following C program is supposed to calculate and print (to two decimal points accuracy) the
square root of every second integer number from 1 to 101 inclusive beginning with 1. There are
four lines that contain errors in this program, which are either syntax or logical errors.

double root;

number = sqrt((double) root);

= 1; number < 101; number += 2) {

printf("The Square Root of %0.2f is %.1f\n", number, root);

For each line that has error(s), state, in the following table, the line number that error(s), and give
the correct statement.

Question 7 [3 Marks]

Print the output produced by an execution of the following C program.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {

char firstChar = ’A’;
char secondChar = ’U’;

printf("%c", firstChar + 3);
firstChar += 4;
printf("%c", firstChar);
printf("%c", firstChar - 3);
printf("%c", secondChar);
firstChar++;
firstChar++;
printf("%c\n", firstChar);

return (EXIT_SUCCESS);

}

Question 8 [3 Marks]

What does the following program print?

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
int i, j, k;

for (i = 10; i <= 14; i = i + 2) {

for (j = 5; j > 0; j--) {

k = i + j;
printf("%d ", k);

}

}

return (EXIT_SUCCESS);

}

Question 9 [2 Marks]

There have been four plenary lectures so far in this course, and there is one question from each
below. You should give a written answer for two of these four questions. The answer should be
one or two sentences. If you answer more than two questions, you must indicate which two you
wish to be graded; if you do not indicate which, then the ﬁrst two in order will be graded.

Plenary Lecture 1 — Creative Application for Mobile Devices (Professor Jonathan Rose)
This lecture discussed the many capabilities of a smartphone, and many different applications
of them in research and that have been deployed. It ﬁnished with two key messages relating to
1) What is possible with smartphones, and 2) the potential impact they can have. Give, in one
sentence, the essence of those two key messages you were asked to ’take home.’

Plenary Lecture 2 — Serial Software Entrepreneur (Bobby John)
What was the one question that Mr. John suggested that every company should ask itself in relation
to software?

7

Plenary Lecture 3 — Machine Learning and Big Data (Dr. Inmar Givoni)
Dr. Givoni gave a high-level description of how an artiﬁcial neural network learns something —
for example they can learn what a human face looks like. Describe, in just a few sentences, that
method.

Plenary Lecture 4 — From Software to Circuits (Professor Jason Anderson)
What are the advantages of implementing a computation in a hardware circuit compared to im-
plementing it in software running on a computer?

Question 10 [6 Marks]

Write a complete C program that ﬁrst prompts the user for a character. The program then de-
termines if the character is an upper-case letter (A-Z), a lower-case letter (a-z), a digit (0-9), or a
special character (all other cases). Recall that the upper-case letters have consecutive encodings in
the ASCII table. Likewise, the lower-case letters have consecutive encodings in the ASCII table,
and the digits do as well.

Here are four sample executions of the program that illustrate the four cases your program must
handle:

Enter a character: A
UPPER CASE.

Enter a character: 1
DIGIT.

Enter a character: e
LOWER CASE.

Enter a character: !
SPECIAL.

int main(void) {

}

Question 11 [6 Marks]
Write a C function reverseDigits, the prototype of which is given below, that takes an integer
argument value, and returns an integer with its digits reversed. For example, if the argument is
1234, the function will return 4321.

int reverseDigits(int value) {

}

10

Question 12 [6 Marks]
In 1706, John Machin, then a professor in London UK, devised a formula for calculating π:

π
4

= 4 · arctan(

1
5

) − arctan(

1
239

)

where the arctan values can be calculated using the following formula:

arctan(x) = x −

x3
3

+

x5
5

−

x7
7

+

x9
9

. . . −

x299
299

+

x301
301

Write a C program that calculates and prints π using this method, printing 10 digits after the
decimal point. You must deﬁne your own function called arctan to compute the arctan values,
and you are not allowed to use the atan function from the math library. When your program is
run, its output should be:

Pi = 3.1415926536

11

Question 13 [6 Marks]
Write a complete C program that reads as input from the terminal, an int type variable called
index, which will be in the range from 0 to 9 (your program may assume this). The program
should then print a 10-line pattern, where each line contains all of the digits. The ﬁrst line will
begin with index and print all digits on the same line in ascending order until 9 is reached, at
which point it will “wrap around” to 0 and print the remaining unprinted digits ascending until
index - 1. The next line will repeat the pattern, beginning with index + 1.

Here are two sample executions of the program:

Enter index: 0
0123456789
1234567890
2345678901
3456789012
4567890123
5678901234
6789012345
7890123456
8901234567
9012345678

Enter index: 3
3456789012
4567890123
5678901234
6789012345
7890123456
8901234567
9012345678
0123456789
1234567890
2345678901

Please write your solution on the next page.

Question 14 [6 Marks]

Write a complete C program that prompts the user to input a single character repeatedly. When
the most recent three characters form the pattern NAN the program should print out, on a separate
line, Pattern NAN found! The program should ﬁnish and print the word Done on a separate
line when the character ‘F’ is entered.

Here is a sample execution of the program that illustrates how it operates:

Input Next Character: T
Input Next Character: N
Input Next Character: B
Input Next Character: N
Input Next Character: A
Input Next Character: N
Pattern NAN found!
Input Next Character: A
Input Next Character: N
Pattern NAN found!
Input Next Character: N
Input Next Character: A
Input Next Character: A
Input Next Character: N
Input Next Character: A
Input Next Character: N
Pattern NAN found!
Input Next Character: B
Input Next Character: A
Input Next Character: N
Input Next Character: A
Input Next Character: N
Pattern NAN found!
Input Next Character: A
Input Next Character: N
Pattern NAN found!
Input Next Character: F
Done
