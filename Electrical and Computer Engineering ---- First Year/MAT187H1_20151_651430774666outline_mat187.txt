Course Description

Topics include: techniques of integration, introduction to second order diﬀerential equations, sequences

and series, vector-valued functions, functions of several variables, partial diﬀerentiation and applica-

tions to mechanics and other engineering problems.

Textbook.

Calculus for Scientists and Engineers: Early Transcendentals1, 1st Edition, by Briggs,

Cochran & Gillett, ISBN 9780321837721.

Online Textbook.

Instead of obtaining the physical textbook, you can opt to obtain the online

textbook with mathlab, which is cheaper than the (new) textbook and includes interactive material:

It is also available through CourseSmart (without interactive material, but it has an app for tablets):

MathLab Online Textbook

Discussion Board

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you

help fast and eﬃciently from classmates, the TA, and the instructors. Rather than emailing questions

to the teaching staﬀ, we encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems

or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

Find the class page at: https://piazza.com/class/i358w8q5xmt173

Homework Assignments

There will be SIX Homework assignments posted on WeBWorK, which you must submit by the due

date.

These assignments will be given throughout the course which will cover the recent material discussed

in lectures. These are designed to assist students in understanding the course material. They also

serve as good practice for term tests, and the ﬁnal exam, as questions on these will be approximately

the same level as questions on the assignments.

You are expected to work on the questions assigned, and if you cannot solve a problem, you should

ask your TA and/or an instructor for help.

Your Homework mark will be determined by the taking the average of the best FIVE assignments.

Term Tests

See the course schedule below for dates, times, and location for each term test. More details about

the term test will be given later. You must bring your student card. No aids will be allowed.

Missing a Term Test.

If you cannot show up for a test because of illness or any other special

reason, you MUST contact the First Year Common Engineering Oﬃce before the time of the test or

within 1 week. You MUST also submit the oﬃcial UofT medical certiﬁcate, which can be downloaded

from the course website.

There will be NO make-up tests. The marking scheme will be adjusted properly for students who

have missed the test because of illness or any other (approved) legitimate reason.

Class Expectations

One of our main concerns is to provide you with good conditions for optimal study. Because of this

reason:

• We expect you to come to class on time. If you happen to be late, please take a seat without

disturbing your colleagues.

• We expect you to be attentive and ask questions about concepts and problems you don’t under-

stand.

• This is a large class: chatting with your classmates during lecture is extremely disturbing for

everybody in the class; although you don’t realize it, it gets very loud. If you do disturb the

class repeatedly, you will be asked to leave the class and come back when you think you can sit

there quietly. Once the class starts, we expect you to interrupt any personal conversation.

• Use of cell phones, laptops, iPods, and other electronic devices is not allowed. Once

the class begins, you are expected to turn oﬀ any electronic device. Just pretend it’s a long

take-oﬀ, or landing.

Code of Behaviour / Plagiarism

Students should become familiar with and are expected to adhere to the Code of Behaviour on Aca-

demic Matters which can be found at:

http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm
