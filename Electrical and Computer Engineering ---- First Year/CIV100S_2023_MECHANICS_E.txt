1. The cross-section of a 3.0 m-wide (in the plane of the figure), fresh-water tank with a slanted bottom is 
presented. A rectangular door in the bottom of the tank, 1.6 m by 0.8 m (normal to the plane of the figure), 
is hinged at A and can be opened by the vertical cable under a tension P, as shown. Determine the 
minimum tension force in the cable required to open the door. The door is fabricated from 25 mm-thick 
steel plate with a mass density of 7,850 kg/m’ and the cross-sectional area of the cable is 200 mm\

2. The truss illustrated below is composed of eight identical equilateral triangular panels having a modular 
size of 8 m, and is supported by a pin at J and a vertical cable at D.

a.  Determine the forces in members BC, CD, DF and GH, and indicate if they are in tension or 

Compression. The line of action of the 50 kN force at E makes a 90-degree angle with member 
EF.

b.  Member CD is a cable made from a bundle of 60 round, solid, high-strength, parallel steel wires, 
each wire having a diameter of 2 mm. Determine the axial stress in the cable CD resulting from 
the loading applied to the truss.

c.  Determine the elongation of member CD. The modulus of elasticity for the cable material is 160 

GPa.

3. A heavy door seals a furnace which is used to heat-treat large metal components. Post BE is round and 
is connected to the foundation by a fixed support at E. The door has a weight of 20 kN which acts through 
point G located at the centre of the 18 x 18 dm door. In the closed position (shown) the door panel is 
parallel to the z axis and the hinge arm segments are parallel to the x and z axes. Determine the force 
supported by the cable AB and the reaction force components at the bearings (hinges), at points C and D.
The two bearings are free to translate in they direction. All dimensions are in dm (decimetres). (Note: The 
decimetre is an SI unit of length equal to one tenth of a metre.)

5. The steel beam depicted below is supported by a frictionless surface at A and a fixed support at C. 
Member AB is loaded by a uniformly distributed force and is pinned to member BC at B.

In the space provided draw the internal-force diagrams for the beam. Indicate the values at all points 

marked along the beam (viz. A, B, C, 1 and 2) and annotate the shape of the diagrams.

(b) The cross-section of the beam is also represented. Determine the second moment of the area of the 
cross-section corresponding to the axis of bending.
