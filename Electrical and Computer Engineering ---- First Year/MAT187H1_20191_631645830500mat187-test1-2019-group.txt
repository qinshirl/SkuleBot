LONG ANSWER PART

3.

It’s the 1960’s and NASA is trying to ﬁnd out how much work it will take

(6 marks)

to get a spaceship to escape the gravitational pull of Earth. This means that the spaceship should

be able to keep going forever, getting further and further away from Earth.

The formula for work is W = F d, where F is the force acting on the object and d is the displacement.
GM m
r2
M is the mass of the Earth, m is the mass of the spaceship, and r is the distance from the centre of

, where G is the universal gravitational constant,

The gravitational pull of Earth has magnitude

the Earth. You can denote the radius of the Earth as R.

(a) (2 marks) Find an integral formula for the work it takes to bring a spaceship from the surface

of the Earth to a distance h from the surface.

Explain every step and deﬁne all your variables and constants.

(You can continue your answer to (a) on the next page)

(b) (1 mark) Find an integral formula for the work it takes for a spaceship starting from the surface

of the Earth to go on forever getting further and further away from Earth. Justify your answer.

Hint. You don’t need to solve the integral.

(c) (1 mark) Is the amount of work from (b) ﬁnite or inﬁnite? Justify your answer.

(d) (2 marks) In reality, the mass of the spaceship also decreases, due to diminishing fuel.

Assume that the mass of the spaceship is given by




4a − br

m(r) =

if br < 3a

(burning fuel)



a

if br = 3a

(ran out of fuel)

where a and b are positive constants.

Is the amount of work it takes for a spaceship starting from the surface of the Earth to go on

forever, getting further and further away from Earth, ﬁnite or inﬁnite? Justify your answer.
