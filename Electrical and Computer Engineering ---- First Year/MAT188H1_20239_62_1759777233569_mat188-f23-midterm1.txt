6. A colony of ants travels between three different locations: their anthill, the strawberry
patch, and by the puddle. Let’s denote these by A, S, and P , respectively. The ants
only walk on their constructed one-way paths, and they walk in a rhythmic pattern:
Every minute, at the start of the minute, each ant will randomly follow one of the paths.
If several paths are available, then an equal proportion of the ants will follow each of
them. By the end of the minute, they are at their destination. The locations and the
pre-constructed paths are shown in the diagram.

Let x1, x2, and x3 be the proportions of the ants who
find themselves at A, S, and P , respectively, at the start
of a minute; we collect this information in a distribution

vector ⃗x =

minute their distribution remains the same? If yes, find all such initial distributions.
If no, why not?
