4. Let A, B, and C be n × n matrices. Which of the following statements are TRUE?

(i) If Ax = Bx for every x ∈ Rn, then A = B.

(ii) If A (cid:54)= 0 and AB = AC, then B = C.

(iii) Either the system Ax = b has a unique solution for every b ∈ Rn or there exist non-trivial solutions to the homogenous

system Ax = 0.

(B) (ii) only
(C) (i) and (iii) only
(D) (i), (ii), and (iii)
(E) none of (i), (ii), or (iii)

Answer: C
Solution:
i) If A and B diﬀer in the jth column then we can consider x=ej. The output of A · x will be the jth column of A. The

output of B · x will be the jth column of B. If these outputs are the same, the columns cannot diﬀer.

iii) This is true. The forwards direction is true because if there were two diﬀerent solutions to the equation we would have
Ax1 = b and Ax2 = b. Thus, Ax1 − Ax2 = 0 so A(x1 − x2) = 0. The backwards direction is true because we can just choose
b = 0 and we have found our solution.

5. Let u, v, w be non-zero, non-parallel vectors in R4 and let W = span{u, v − u, u − w, v + w}. Determine all possible values
of dim(W ).
(A) 4
(B) 1 or 2
(C) 2 or 3
(D) 1, 2, or 3
(E) 1, 2, 3, or 4

Answer: C
Solution:
We observe that since 2u + (v − u) − (u − w) − (v + w) = 0, then the set whose span makes up W is not linearly independent
and so we can remove one of the vectors from the set and W will be unchanged. This also makes sense as all 4 vectors in the
deﬁnition of W are linear combinations of only three vectors, u, v, and w. Thus, dim(W ) cannot be 4. Also, if u and v are not
parallel, then u and v − u are not parallel so dim(W ) is at least 2. Thus, the only option that this leaves us C.

(a) Determine rank(A) and nullity(A). [2 marks]

The rank of a matrix is equal to the dimension of the row space, since the row space is invariant under row operations, and the
dimension of the row space of R is clearly 2, rank(A)=2.

By the rank-nullity theorem, we know that since A has 5 columns, rank(A)+nullity(A)=5 and since rank(A)=2, nullity(A)=3.

(b) Find a basis for row(A). [2 marks]

Whenever we perform a row operation on A, the basis for the row space of the resulting matrix will still be a basis for the row
space of the initial matrix. Thus, any basis for row(R) will be a basis for row(A).

It is clear that an adequate basis for row(R) is

Since the row rank of A is equal to the column rank of A, we need to choose two linearly independent columns for our basis.

We need to solve Ax = 0. We can perform row operations on this system until it is of the form Rx = 0. Thus, we get two
constrains, that x1 = -x4 − x5 and x3 = x4 − x5. If we set x2 = a, x4 = b, and x5 = c, we get that

Notice that W is the set of solutions to the homogeneous equation x1 + x2 + x3 = 0. Since the set of solutions requires two

At this point we can stop. We see that the rank of A may be 2 if the expression 2 − c − c2 = (1 − c)(c + 2) is equal to 0. i.e.
c = 1 or c = −2. However, if c = 1 the rank of A is 1 and the dimension of W is 1. If c = −2, the rank of A is 2 and so the only
value of c for which the dimension of W is 2 is -2.

6. The diagram below is a map of a downtown area of a city. Each street is one-way in the direction of the respective arrows.
The numbers represent the average number of cars per minute that enter or leave a given street at 6:00pm. The variables also
represent the average numbers of cars per minute. Of course, unless there is an accident, the total number of cars entering any
intersection must equal the total number leaving. Thus, at the intersection of West and North street we have x + y = 50.

(a) Starting at the intersection of West and North Street, and continuing clockwise around the square, write a system of linear
equations that describes the traﬃc ﬂow (assuming there are no accidents) and ﬁnd all solutions to this system. You should ﬁnd
there are inﬁnitely many solutions with one parameter. Use w as your free variable. [5 marks]

In the order indicated in the problem, we write a system of equation by added all the incoming cars and subtracting all of the
leaving cars and setting that equal to 0. Thus we get

x + y − 20 − 30 = 0

20 − x − w = 0

z + w − 20 − 30 = 0

50 + 30 − y − z = 0

(b) Nefarious Construction Co. wants to close down West Street for six months but the City Council refused to grant the permit.
Explain why on the basis of the solutions to the system in part (a). [3 marks]

This has the same eﬀect as setting x = 0, and by part a, this means that w = 20, so y = 50 and z = 30. This has the eﬀect
of causing massive traﬃc jams along North Street. Before, when we had a smaller value for w, such as 10, there was 20% less
traﬃc among North Street and it could operate ﬁne.
