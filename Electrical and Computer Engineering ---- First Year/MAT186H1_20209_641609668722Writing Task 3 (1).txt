Infectious Disease Modeling Modules: D2, D3  

In this problem set, we examine a simple model for the spread of a contagious disease. Our model makes the 

following assumptions:  

• The disease can only be transmitted by human-to-human contact in a single specific population;  

• The size of the population remains constant in time (that is, no births or deaths occur and the population is 

cut out  from the outside world);  

• The disease confers no immunity after someone has recovered from infection.  

Of course, these assumptions limit the applicability of our model to real-life epidemics, but they provide a good

foundation upon which more complex and accurate models can be based. Let time be denoted by 𝑡 ∈ [0, ∞),

measured in days. From the above assumptions, the population can be divided into two groups:  

• 𝑆(𝑡) = 

fraction of the population that is susceptible 

to infection but not actually infected at time 𝑡, and 

 • 𝐼(𝑡) = 

fraction of the population that is infected 

at time 𝑡.  

Our model requires two parameters with values in (0, 1): the infection rate 𝑎 and the recovery rate 𝑏, both with

units of (days)

−1

​(in practice, these numbers would need to be estimated using patient data). In words, we can

think of 𝑏Δ𝑡 as the

proportion of infected individuals recovering

and returning to the susceptible group over a

small time interval of length Δ𝑡. Similarly, we can think of 𝑎Δ𝑡 in the following way:

out of all those susceptibles

who came into contact with an infected individual during the small time interval, 𝑎Δ𝑡 is the proportion who

actually end up getting infected as a result of that contact

.

Your answer must be contained in one or two sentences.  

A: People in the population can either be infected or not infected, in which case they are susceptible. Therefore, 

the sum of the proportion of the people who are infected and susceptible must equal one because the sum 

represents the entire population. 

2. In this problem, we derive an ordinary differential equation that can be solved (or simulated) to find 𝐼(𝑡). For

now, suppose that at every instant in time everyone in the population is in contact with one and only one other

person. Every Δ𝑡 days, the contacts change up. So the

proportion of people whose contact is an infected person

during a time interval

is approximately 𝐼(𝑡) and the

proportion of people whose contact is a susceptible person

during a time interval 

is approximately 𝑆(𝑡).  

(a) Let Δ𝐼

denote the change in 𝐼(𝑡) due only to recoveries occurring in the time interval [𝑡, 𝑡 +Δ𝑡]. Argue

               Δ𝐼

​recovered 

A: As stated earlier, 

 is the proportion of infected individuals recovering and becoming susceptible over 

. To get the proportion of the total population that is recovering, multiply the proportion of infected individuals 

that are recovering by the proportion of individuals that are infected, meaning the expression we get is 

. 

Since this is the proportion of individuals coming out of the infected group, the proportion of individuals infected 

goes down by 

, hence the change  Δ𝐼

is equal to

denote the change in 𝐼(𝑡) due only to infections occurring in the time interval [𝑡, 𝑡 + Δ𝑡]. Argue

We need this expression in terms of

remains in terms of

4. How do you think solutions of (6) will behave as 𝑡 → ∞ when 𝑎 and 𝑏 are chosen so that 𝑅
​0

∈ (0, 1)? Answer

in four sentences or less.  

A: If

​0 is between 0 and 1, that means that
R

meaning

a < b which would mean that, as explained

earlier,

is negative. As

t approaches infinity, the function

I(t) is just going to keep on decreasing. However,

I

cannot become negative because if this were the case,

would instantly become positive and

I would instantly

rise above the x-axis again. This means that

I(t) is going to asymptomatically approach 0 as that is the only way it

can be decreasing forever but not negative.
