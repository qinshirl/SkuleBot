2016 – Midterm Vocabulary List and information 

Information: The following instructions will appear on the first page of the midterm test.  

This is a 70 minute midterm with 39 questions and 15 pages. It is a multiple choice midterm and is closed 
book. No aids are permitted. Read each question thoroughly and provide the answer on the answer sheet. 
Be sure to fill out the answer sheet clearly with no overlaps. Fill out the answer sheet using a pencil. Erase 
any errors completely. Provide only 1 answer per question and each correct answer is worth 1 mark. There is 
no deduction for wrong answers. Select the answer that best satisfies the question. You are not required to 
hand in the exam question booklet. You may tear off the appendix to ease the answering of questions. 

Case study: The case study will appear in an appendix to the test. The case study deals with an anti-theft system for 
chewing gum. We are assuming you have read and understood everything in the case study and the 
company fact sheet that was posted with the case study. If you have questions about the case study or fact 
sheet, please ask a member of the teaching team before the exam. No questions about the case study will 
be answered during the exam. We do not expect you to have formulated a solution for this problem. 

Vocabulary: We will assume that you know (and can answer questions about) the terms that appear in the 

textbook, case study and readings, or that have appeared in lectures and assignments.  

The following is a list of some additional words you may find on the Midterm. It does not include all of the 
words on the exam, and some of these words will not appear on the exam. Words that have been 
specifically defined or discussed in lecture or readings are not listed (e.g. function, stakeholder, etc.). 
Familiarity with these words will help you move more quickly through the exam. You should also be familiar 
with their plural form, past tense form, and so on. If you already have a good understanding of the 
common meaning of these words, then there is no need to look them up in a dictionary, or spend any 
additional time studying them.
