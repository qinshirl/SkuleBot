Question 1 [2 Marks]
Write a single line C statement that computes the expression below for the variable y which is
computed based on variables x and z. You can assume that all of the functions in the C math
library are available, and that x, y and z have already been declared as double-type variables.

y =

(cid:114) 50.0

1.0 − e−x/z

Please write your answer here:

Question 2 [2 Marks]
Assume that three integer variables, a, b and c have been declared and set to some value greater
than zero. It is possible to compute, for each variable, the remainder when it is divided by 10.
Write a single C statement that computes the real-number average of those three remainders.

Please write your answer here:

Question 3 [2 Marks]
Consider the portion of a C program shown below. Assume that variables a, b, and c (which are
declared at the top of the program) have their values set as given in each line of the table below,
after which the code is executed. For each such case, give the value of the variable m in the table
after the code is executed. Please write your answer directly into the table, under the column
labelled m.

int a, b, c, m;

// assume that the values of a, b, c are set as in the table below
if ((a < b) && (a < c))

m = a;

else if ((b < a) && (b < c))

m = b;

else if ((c < a) && (c < b))

Consider the following code segment containing three if statements:

if (a == b)

if (c != d)

if (e == f)

printf("Are you kidding me????\n");

Please write a C code segment that behaves exactly like the above code, but that contains only one
if statement.

Please write your answer here:

Question 5 [2 Marks]
Write a single C statement that declares a double variable randomSelection, and initializes it
with a number that is randomly selected from the following set: 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35,
0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95.

Please write your answer here:

Question 6 [2 Marks]

Consider the following code, which uses pointers:

int a, b, c, d;
int *e, *f;

a = 5;
b = 6;

e = &c;
f = &d;

*e = a + b;
*f = *e + b;

e = &a;
f = &b;

*e = c + d;
*f = a + b;

What are the values of the variables a and b after this code is executed?

Please write your answer here:

5

Question 7 [2 Marks]
Assume a program has three boolean variables, a, b, and c, which can each have a value of true
or false. In the space provided below, please list all combinations of values for a, b, and c, for
which the following code segment does not print out “Success!!”.

bool a, b, c;

...
...
...

// other code here...

if (!(a && !(b || c)))

printf( "Success!!" );

...

For example, if your answer were:

a: false b: true

c: false

then your answer would not be correct, because !(false && !(true || false)) is true
and hence “Success!!” would be printed.

List all combinations for which “Success!!” would not be printed here:

Question 8 [2 Marks]

(a) Consider the function:

void printSomething(int n);

and the following for loop that calls the function:

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)

printSomething(i);

Write a code segment that has the same effect as the above for loop but only uses a while
loop (without using a for loop or a do-while loop).

(b) Assume variable i has been declared and has a value. Further, assume the following func-

tion exists:

int someFunctionCall(int n);

Then, consider the following do-while loop:

...
do

i = someFunctionCAll(i);

while (i >= 0);

Write a code segment that has the same effect as the above code but only uses a regular
while loop (without using a for loop or a do-while loop).

Question 9 [2 Marks]

There have been ﬁve plenary lectures so far in this course, and below there is one question from
each. You need only answer two of these ﬁve questions. Each answer should be one or two
sentences. If you answer more than two questions, you must indicate which two you wish to be
graded; if you do not indicate which, then the ﬁrst two in order will be graded.

Plenary Lecture 1 — Creative Application for Mobile Devices (Prof. Jonathan Rose)
This lecture discussed the many capabilities of a smartphone, and different apps that were created
for research and regular use. One application that was discussed and demonstrated was called
‘MyAnkle’ and it used an accelerometer, in a wearable device to measure something. What did it
measure and why was that useful to measure?

Answer:

Plenary Lecture 2 — Software at Google Scale (Danyao Wang)
Question: Name three things, according to Danyao Wang at Google, that need to be present in the
process of software engineering.

Answer:

8

Plenary Lecture 3 — How Facebook Software is Made (Prof. Michael Stumm)
Describe the nature of the tasks that Professor Stumm’s new kind of ‘complete’ agile software
engineer must undertake.

Answer:

Plenary Lecture 4 — An EE’s Journey to Software (Prof. Vaughn Betz)
What did the company that installed the MRI machine in a European Hospital ask Professor Betz’s
company to do to help them with their problem?

Answer:

Plenary Lecture 5 — User Experience Design (Jason Hyde, Plastic Mobile)
Mr. Hyde suggested that one particular user interface ‘element’ (or method) had become one of
the most popular ways of providing navigation around mobile applications. What was that the
name of that method, and how did it work?

Answer:

Question 10 [6 Marks]

This question has two, connected, parts. In the ﬁrst part you will write the code for a function,
and in the second part you will write the main function that makes use of that function.

(a) Write a function, called whichBiggerAndHowMuch that receives two integer values as its
input parameters (among other possible input parameters that you’re free to choose) and produces
two outputs: ﬁrst, it should return (using the return statement) a bool-type variable which will
be true if the ﬁrst number is greater than or equal to the second number, and false otherwise.
Second, it should also send back the absolute value of the difference between the larger and the
smaller number (i.e. this number must be positive). You can assume that both of the input integers
are positive.

Please write your solution here:

10

(b) Write the main function of a C program that asks the user for two integer inputs, and then calls
the above function (whichBiggerAndHowMuch) to determine which of the two is larger, and the
difference. Here are two different executions of the main program that show you what the input
and output should look like:

Example Run 1:

Enter first and second number: 56 22
First number is bigger by 34

Example Run 2:

Enter first and second number: 12 16
Second number is bigger by 4

Please write your solution here:

11

Question 11 [6 Marks]

Write a complete C program that prints out the following pattern, as a function of an input value
n. The following is an example run for n = 6:

Enter n: 5
@@@@@@
@
@@
@
@ @
@ @ @

@@@@@@

The following is an example run for n = 8:

Enter n: 8
@@@@@@@@
@
@@
@
@ @
@ @
@
@ @
@
@ @

@@
@@@@@@@@

Your program must request the number n from the user at the beginning, and you can assume that
the value of n is greater than 2.

Your program may make use of the following function, which you can assume is written before
your code:

void printNChar(int numC, char c) {
for (int i = 1; i <= numC; i++)

printf("%c", c);

}

Question 12 [6 Marks]
sin(x) can be calculated using the Maclaurin series:

sin(x) = x −

x3
3!

+

x5
5!

−

x7
7!

+

x9
9!

− ·

where n! is the factorial of n, deﬁned as n! = n × (n − 1) × (n − 2) × . . . × 3 × 2 × 1.

Write a complete C program that ﬁrst prompts the user for a double value x, and then computes
sin(x) using the ﬁrst 10 terms in the Maclaurin series, and ﬁnally prints it with 6 digits after the
decimal point. Here is an example run of your program:

Enter a value: 3.1415926
result = 0.000000

Question 13 [7 Marks]

Write a complete C program that reads an English sentence from user input, and prints out
“Found ECE!” if the sentence contains three consecutive characters that spell ECE. You can as-
sume that the sentence ends with a ’.’ character. Your program should read in one character
after another until it reads an ‘E’ followed immediately by a ‘C’ followed immediately by an ‘E’,
at which time it should print out “Found ECE!”. The program should not print anything if ECE
is not found in the sentence. You are not allowed to use an array in your solution.

Here is an example run of your program:

Please enter a sentence: This course is taught by ECE professors.
Found ECE!

Question 14 [7 Marks]

Write a complete C program that prompts the user repeatedly for a sequence of up to 10 integer
values. After receiving all 10 values, or if the user enters 0, the program will stop prompting
for more values. You can assume that the user enters at least one value before entering 0. Your
program will complete the following three tasks, in the order as given below, using the values the
user entered:

• Print the total number of values entered;

• Print all the values in the order that the user entered them;

• Print whether the values are entered in ascending order, i.e., the next value is either greater
than or equal to the previous one. For example, {3, 4, 7, 7} is a sequence of values in
ascending order, but {3, 4, 7, 6} is not.

Hint: you will need to use an array for this question.

Here are a few example runs of your program.

Example run 1:

Enter a value (0 to stop): 1
Enter a value (0 to stop): 2
Enter a value (0 to stop): 3
Enter a value (0 to stop): 4
Enter a value (0 to stop): 7
Enter a value (0 to stop): 7
Enter a value (0 to stop): 8
Enter a value (0 to stop): 9
Enter a value (0 to stop): 10
Enter a value (0 to stop): 11
There are a total of 10 numbers.
The values you entered are: 1 2 3 4 7 7 8 9 10 11
The values are in ascending order.

Example run 2:

Enter a value (0 to stop): 3
Enter a value (0 to stop): 5
Enter a value (0 to stop): 5
Enter a value (0 to stop): 7
Enter a value (0 to stop): 0
There are a total of 4 numbers.
The values you entered are: 3 5 5 7
The values are in ascending order.

18

Example run 3:

Enter a value (0 to stop): 2
Enter a value (0 to stop): 1
Enter a value (0 to stop): 3
Enter a value (0 to stop): 0
There are a total of 3 numbers.
The values you entered are: 2 1 3
The values are not in ascending order.

Example run 4:

Enter a value (0 to stop): 1
Enter a value (0 to stop): 0
There are a total of 1 numbers.
The values you entered are: 1
The values are in ascending order.
