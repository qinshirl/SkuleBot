At t = 0, a particle is located at (cid:2) = 0°.  The particle travels for a short distance on the path 
 (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4)(cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11) meters such that its angular velocity is (cid:10)(cid:12) (cid:3) (cid:13)(cid:14) rad/s, where t is in seconds.    

    a)  Find the time t when the particle is at (cid:2) = 60°. [10 marks] 

   b) Find the velocity of the particle at (cid:2) = 60°.  Express the result in the polar (r-(cid:2)) coordinate 

system shown in the figure. [10 marks] 

    c)  Express the velocity of the particle at (cid:2) = 60° in normal-tangential (n-t) coordinates. 

[10 marks] 

    d)  Find the radial component of the particle’s acceleration, ar, when the particle is at (cid:2) = 60°.

Question 2 [30 marks total]

A 5 kg block sits on a conical dish that is rotating at a constant rate of 10 rad/s about the vertical 

axis (Figure 2). The static coefficient of friction between the block and the dish is μs = 0.28.  

Determine r, the distance between the vertical axis and the block, at which the block is on the 
verge of sliding up the dish.

Question 3 [30 marks total]

A block “B” of mass 25 kg is connected to a spring with stiffness constant k = 20 N/m. At the 
position shown in Figure 3, the spring is stretched by 4 meters. The block is on a slope of angle 

50° with (cid:3)k = 0.15. 

a)   Suppose the block is released from the position shown. For what values of (cid:3)s will the 

block not start to slide down the hill? [10 marks] 

      b)   Suppose the block is initially sliding down the slope at 3 m/s at the position shown. What 

is the magnitude of its acceleration at the position shown? [10 marks] 

      c)   Suppose the block is initially moving down the slope at 3 m/s at the position shown. 
What will be the block’s speed when it has traveled 1.5 meters? [10 marks]
