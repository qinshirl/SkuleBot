Question 1. (7 points)Determine if the following statements 
are True or False. In case that they are false, provide a counter 
example.

(1)  If matrix A is in reduced row-echelon form, then at least 

one of the entries in each column must be 1.

(2)  Given that U and V are subspaces ofW^, then U nV is 

a subspace ofW^.

(3)  If A is an orthogonal matrix, then det{A) = 1.
(4)  If A is ann xn matrix with n distinct eigenvalues, then 

A is symmetric.

(5)  If T ; R” IR” is a linear map corresponding to pro­
jection to a subspace W, and S ; R" R" is reflection 
about W-^, then T o S is not invertible.

(6) The matrix

is similar to

0 0

with rank^A) = 2 and

tr{A') = 3.

(b) A 3 X 3 matrix A, such that AA"^ = 4I3.

Linear map S,T ; R’ 
and rank{T o S') = 2.

R’ such that rank{S o T) = 2

(d) A 4x4 upper triangular matrix A, such that A is or­

thogonally diagonalizable and det{A) = tr{A).

agonalizable.
