2. 

3. 

4. 
5. 
6. 

The tutorials will commence the week of January 12th 2015. There will be no tutorials during the first 
week of classes. 
each Tutorial, there will be a Tutorial Problem Set. The TA will go over the solutions to some of the 
problems, but one or more problems will be assigned to the students for solution during the last 15 
minutes of each session. (open book), and submit each Tutorial Problem Set (which will be marked 
by the TAs). The marked problems will be returned the following week at the end of the tutorial. 
Students must bring their text book(s) with them for the open book Tutorial Problem Set. (A 
Formula Sheet will not be provided.) 
Each tutorial will be 50m minutes in length.  
There will also be no tutorials during Reading Week or during the week of March 30 – April 3 
For the tutorials during the weeks of Feb 9-13 and  March 16-20 (i.e. the weeks with the two 
midterm exams) there will be tutorials, but no marked problems. 

Tutorial Program 

1.  All students are required to attend their respective tutorial sections, no exceptions. Do Not Switch 

Tutorial Sections! 

2.  All students are expected to solve the assigned problems prior to coming to the tutorials. Reading 

through the additional specified review problems is also recommended. 

3.  During each weekly tutorial, the TAs will handout a Tutorial Problem Set that students are required to 
solve and hand-in at the end of the tutorial hour. The TAs will only assist by answering conceptual 
questions and providing hints as appropriate. Students are more than welcome to discuss with TAs, but 
should not completely rely on TAs to help solve the Problem Set. 

4.  Students will work individually and each student will submit a Tutorial Problem Set for marking. 

Textbook and any handouts are allowed during the tutorial section. 

5. 

In order to succeed in this course, solving the assigned problems and attending the tutorials is 
essential. Practicing to solve as many problems as possible is the key to success.

STUDY POINTERS 

Studying 

Effective  studying  consists  of  taking  lecture  notes,  active  reading  of  the  primary  reading  material, 

tutorial  attendance  and  note  taking,  and  solving  various  exercises  on  your  own.  Begin  studying  your  lecture 

notes by reviewing the lecture outlines. Ask yourself questions about the material; for example, ask yourself to 

provide definitions, to summarize the purpose, method and results of studies. 

Read the chapter "in chunks". The size of these chunks should be determined by natural breaks in the 

text,  and  by  your  ability  to  assimilate  the  material  being  read.  Make  brief  notes  in  the  margins  of  the  text  as 

necessary. It is inadvisable to make extensive notes from the textbook. However, it is helpful to make one- or 

two-page summary notes per chapter showing the major headings and key concepts. 

Note-Taking in Lectures 

If you can, read all the relevant text material before attending the lectures on a given topic. Much of 

learning involves discovering how new information relates to knowledge you already possess. The more you 

know about a particular subject the easier it is to use new information to expand your current knowledge basis. 

If you read the relevant text chapters before you attend the lectures on a particular topic, you will learn more 

from the lectures and you will be able to take better notes. Your familiarity with the key concepts and major 

theories in a specific area will help you judge what is important in a lecture. Review your lecture notes soon 

after each lecture and proceed to read and study the required text. 

Problems 

§  Solving assigned problems is absolutely essential in developing a complete understanding of the concepts 

introduced in the lectures and corresponding chapters/sections. 

§  The term tests and final exam are largely based on the assigned problems as well as conceptual/definition 

type questions to test your grasp of the subject matter. 

§  Please take advantage of the tutorials to clarify issues you do not understand. Do this as questions arise 

rather than wait until just before a test or exam. Ask specific questions on how to solve a given problem, 

rather than “What is the answer to question 5?”
