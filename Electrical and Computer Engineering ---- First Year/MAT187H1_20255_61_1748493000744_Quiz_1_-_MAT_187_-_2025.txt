Instructions
• This is a Type A assessment and does not allow any external aids.
• Read all instructions carefully and justify all your answers. No points will be awarded for a correct

answer without justification.

• Read each question carefully. No clarification or content related questions will be answered.

You may use the following space for scratch work or to continue your solutions if you run out of room. If
you do so, please clearly indicate in the original question that part of your solution appears here.

1. (3 points) A student attempts to evaluate the indefinite integral

x sin(x) dx using integration by
parts. They choose f (x) = sin(x) and g′(x) = x. Without solving the integral, explain why this
is likely not a good choice for integration by parts.

´

Solution: With this choice of f (x) = sin(x) and g′(x) = x, we are differentiating sin(x), which
gives cos(x), and integrating x, which gives 1
2x2. This results in more complicated expressions
during the integration by parts process.
A better choice is to let f (x) = x and g′(x) = sin(x), because differentiating x simplifies to 1, and
integrating sin(x) yields − cos(x), which simplifies the integrand. This leads to a simpler overall
computation.

2. (3 points) In class, we evaluated the integral

´

1

1+x2 dx = arctan(x) using trigonometric substitution.

Explain why partial fraction decomposition is not a suitable method for evaluating this integral.

Solution: The denominator 1 + x2 is an irreducible quadratic polynomial as it cannot be factored
into linear terms using real numbers. Partial fraction decomposition only works when the denom-
inator can be factored into simpler rational terms. While expressions like
x2+1 can appear as part
of a partial fraction decomposition, they are considered terminal forms (can’t be simplified further)
and require a different approach—such as trigonometric substitution—for integration. Therefore,
partial fraction decomposition is not suitable here.

Solution: Let g′(x) = 1 and f (x) = arctan(x), then:

Solution: First we start with polynomial long division to get:

Which gives us the system of equations A = −1 and A + B = 0 so B = 1. Overall we get:

5. (10 points) Consider a cable suspended between two poles located at x = −a and x = a. The cable
forms a shape known as a catenary; however, for small sags and engineering approximations, this curve
can be modeled by a simple parabola:

y(x) =

h
a2 x2

where a is half the horizontal distance between the poles, and h is the vertical sag.
Arc Length Formula: The arclength L of a curve y = f (x) from x = a to x = b is given by:

Using the formula above and the given parabola, set up an integral that computes the total length
of the cable from x = −a to x = a. Then, evaluate the integral and simplify the result as much as
possible.
