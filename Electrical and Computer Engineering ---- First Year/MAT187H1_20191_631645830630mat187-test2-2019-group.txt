DO NOT WRITE ON THE QR CODE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGES.

Read all the instructions carefully.

This test contains 8 pages and a detached formula sheet. Make sure you have all of them.

You can use page 7 for rough work or to complete a question (Mark clearly).

DO NOT DETACH ANY PAGES.

No calculators, cellphones, or any other electronic devices are allowed. If you have a cellphone

with you, it must be turned oﬀ and in a bag underneath your chair.

GOOD LUCK!

3.

It’s 1905 and everyone believes that Kinetic energy is given by the formula

(8 marks)

KC(s) =

m s2.

2

Here, m is the mass of the particle at rest and s is the speed of the particle.

Albert Einstein just published his paper on Special Relativity. In it he claimed that kinetic energy

is actually given by the formula

where c is the speed of light and s is still the speed of the particle.

The scientiﬁc community is very skeptical; after all the new formula KR(s) looks completely diﬀerent
from the classical one KC(s).

Your job is to ﬁnd out how these two formulas are related.

p1(x) centred at a = 0.

(b) (2 marks) Use part (a) to approximate KR(s).

(c) (1 mark) You just approximated KR(s). Compare this approximation to the formula for KC(s).

What do you observe?
