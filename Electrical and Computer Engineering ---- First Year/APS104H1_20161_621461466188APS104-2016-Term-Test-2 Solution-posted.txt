QUESTION  1:  (20  pts).  A  (variable  volume,  e.g.,  balloon)  vessel  filled  with  30  mol  of  O2  (g) 
undergoes adiabatic expansion. Initially, the temperature of the vessel is 400 K.   

1a (5 pts). Determine the final volume of the vessel after the expansion, at which the vessel reaches 
a final state at standard conditions (273 K, 1 atm). 

1b (5 pts). Determine the initial pressure of the vessel, given that the vessel reaches a final state at 
standard conditions (273 K, 1 atm) after the adiabatic expansion. 

              atm 

1c (5 pts). In the PV diagram below, sketch the adiabatic expansion step, clearly indicate the initial 
and final state.

1d (5 pts). In a separate experiment, you have decided to add 200 g of solid sulfur compound into 
the vessel (while it is at the standard conditions, 273 K, 1 atm) and then heat the vessel up to 800 K 
and with a pressure of 50 atm.   

During the heating process, the following reaction occurs and the reaction goes to completion: 

S(solid)+O2(g)à SO2 (g) 

Determine the mole fractions of SO2 at the end of the reaction.

2c. [8 pts] Using bond enthalpy values from the given below, estimate the standard molar enthalpy of 
combustion of ethanol at 25°C according to 

C2H5OH(liq) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(liq) 
At 25°C the standard enthalpies of vaporization of liquid water and of liquid ethanol are 44.01 kJ mol–1 
and 42.59 kJ mol–1, respectively. The enthalpies of complete atomization of gaseous CO2 and gaseous 
H2O are 1609 kJ mol–1 and 920 kJ mol–1, respectively. 

Bond Enthalpies (kJ mol -1) 

C-H 412, C-C 348, C-O 360, O-H 437.7, O=O 498.36 

First consider the gas phase reaction:       C2H5OH(g) + 3O2(g) 

ΔH1
" " " 
"  → 

 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(g) 

Bonds broken (reactants): 

Bonds made (products): 

C=O=O  2× (– 1609) =  – 3218  (given as data) 
H–O–H  3× (– 920)   =  – 2760  (given as data) 
                                        – 5978   

C–H  5× 412     =   2060  (Table 2) 
C–C  1× 348     = 
348  (Table 2) 
C–O  1× 360     =   360  (Table 2) 
O–H  1× 437.7    =   438  (Table 1) 
O=O  3× 498.36  =   1495   (Table 1) 
                                    4701 
Therefore,     ∆H1 = 4701 – 5978 = – 1277 kJ mol–1 

Adding reactions: 

C2H5OH(g) + 3O2(g) 

ΔH1
" " " 
"  → 

 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(g) 

∆H1 = – 1277 

C2H5OH(liq) 

 C2H5OH(g) 

∆H2 = + 42.59 

3H2O(g) 

 3H2O(liq)                       ∆H3 = 3× (– 44.01) = – 132.03 

ΔH2
"  → 
" " " 
ΔH3
" " " 
"  → 

C2H5OH(liq) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(liq)                ∆Htotal = – 1366.44 kJ 
mol–1 

FYI: From standard enthalpies of formation at 25°C the actual value is 
2(– 393.509) + 3(– 285.830) – (– 277.69) – 3(0) = – 1366.82 kJ mol–1 = – 1.367 MJ mol–1  

                Ans: 

– 1.366 MJ mol–1

QUESTION 3 (20 pts): First law of thermodynamics  

10 moles of neon gas (ideal gas) is taken from 1.0 bar pressure and 350 K to 1.143 bar pressure and 400 
K The volume is held constant and the gas is heated directly to 400 K. 
3a. [6 pts] Calculate q, w, and ΔU  

3b. [15 pts] A piston/cylinder contains one mole of a monoatomic ideal gas that is initially at 300 K. It 
is subjected to the following processes. Calculate the final temperature (in K) for each process.

3c. [8 pts] Two moles of O2 gas (ideal gas) is initially at 27 °C and 1.5 bar. It is heated up to 150°C at a 
constant pressure process. Calculate ΔH, ΔU, q, and w for this process. 

3e. [1 pts] Circle the correct answer: 

a)  1 mole of an ideal gas expands from an initial condition to a final condition once in an reversible 
isothermal  process  and  once  in  a  reversible  adiabatic  process.  The  work  done  in  the  second 
process (adiabatic) is more than that of isothermal. 

b)  If a process is adiabatic and expansion against or into a vacuum, the process is isothermal. 

c)  Both w+q and U+q are path dependent functions. 

QUESTION 4 (30 pts): Second and Third law of thermodynamics  
4a.  [14  pts]  1.5  moles  of  a  monoatomic  ideal  gas  is  expanded  from  50°C  and  5  bar  to  3  bar  in  the 
following two processes. Surrondings is at 25°C. 
Calculate  ΔSsystem,  ΔSsurroundings  ,  and  ΔSuniverse  for  each  process.  Is  the  process  spontaneous  or  non-
spontaneous? 

2 pts for each ΔS and one point for spontaneous or non-spontaneous
