1.  Evaluate

Write with confidence. 

𝟓

∫ (𝒙 − 𝟏)√𝒙 + 𝟒 𝒅𝒙

Two good solutions exist.  We can substitute for 𝑥 + 4 (that is the solution shown here), but 
it would actually be much better to use √𝑥 + 4.  Try that one yourselves. 

Let 𝑢 = 𝑥 + 4, so 𝑑𝑢 = 𝑑𝑥.

2.  Find the area of the region between 𝒚 = |𝒙 − 𝟐| and 𝒙 + 𝟐𝒚 = 𝟓. 

AB4  CF16  CF25 

We need to take cases: 

|𝑥 − 2| = {

2 − 𝑥,
𝑥 − 2,

𝑥 < 2
𝑥 ≥ 2

These will intersect at (−1,3) and (3,1) .  So, we need to find the area using two integrals 
(we could use symmetry and just double one of them):

𝐴 = ∫ (

 𝑑𝑥 + ∫ (

3.  A spherical balloon is being filled so that the rate of growth of its radius is constant.   

CF10 

Show that its volume is increasing at a rate that is proportional to its surface area. 

We are given that 

𝑑𝑟

𝑑𝑡

= 𝑘, for some 𝑘.  So:

[This one is optional.  Solve it if you need better marks in the main attribute tested here.  If 
you try this problem, it will not lower your mark.] 

4.  Find  𝐥𝐢𝐦

This limit is of the form 00, so L’Hopital’s rule applies.
