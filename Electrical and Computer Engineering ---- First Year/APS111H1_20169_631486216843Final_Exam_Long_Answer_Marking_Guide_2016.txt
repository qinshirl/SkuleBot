APS111/113 (Fall) 2016 FINAL EXAM: CIs’ LONG ANSWER MARKING GUIDE 

In general, what we are looking for in questions 35, 36, 37: 

•  Understands key course concepts well enough to write intelligently about them, including putting the problem into engineering terms and 

developing appropriate functions, objectives, constraints and research questions 

•  Paragraph level: Communicates using cohesive, unified, well-organized paragraphs with some sentence to sentence relationship 
•  Sentence level: Sentences are clear, concise, and any errors do not impede comprehensibility or significantly impeded ease of reading 

What we do NOT expect under exam–writing conditions: 

•  Research or research citations 
•  Metrics or goals 
•  Perfect grammar, super-polished writing 

Question 35.  

Based on Case Study 3: RFP for a Personal Data Management Assistant, located in Appendix C, in paragraph form (one or more paragraphs) write 
a concise Problem Statement in your own words. You may, if you wish, add a brief introduction, identifying the client. DO NOT COPY SENTENCES 
WORD-FOR-WORD FROM THE CASE STUDY IN YOUR PROBLEM STATEMENT. YOU WILL RECEIVE NO MARKS FOR MATERIAL COPIED WORD-FOR-
WORD FROM THE CASE STUDY. (20 marks)  

Fails (F) 9/20 and below 
Does not recognize the 
actual problem. 
Misidentifies problem. 

Lack of organization or 
structure in paragraphs.

solution-independent 
engineering terms.

& consistent logical 
development of material  

Exceed (A) >16/20 
Recognizes problem, identifies gap 
and transforms information 
entirely into solution independent 
engineering terms. 
Excellent paragraph organization in 
paragraphs: thoughtful topic 
sentence skilfully developed 
through both sentence order and 
use of transition words and 
conjunctions 

 
 
 
 
 
Sentences unrelated to one 
another 

or Inconsistent or 
inaccurate use of 
conjunctions/transition 
phrases  

Overuse/dependence on 
language of question, case 
study, or definitions 

Ideas are lost as a result of 
poor word choice or poor 
sentence structure 

Language of question 
and/or case study 
mixed with some 
personal language 

Ideas are 
comprehensible with 
effort; everyday 
vocabulary dominates 

Major and/or frequent 
syntax, usage, vocabulary 
or language form errors 

Somewhat free of 
syntax, usage, 
vocabulary or language 
form errors 

Satisfactory paragraph 
organization: clear 
relationship between 
topic sentences and 
organization of following 
sentences, careful choice 
of transition or linking 
strategies. 
Language of case study, 
questions used 
strategically and 
accurately with mostly 
personal language 
Meaning is clear at 
paragraph, sentence, and 
word choice level with 
minimal error  

Sentences are simple, 
direct; mostly accurate 
use of course terms, 
some repetition 

Mostly free of syntax, 
usage, vocabulary or 
language form errors 

Guides the reader with appropriate 
use of structure, presentation, & 
word choices  

Language of case study/questions 
integrated with student’s language 
as part of the discipline discourse 

Meaning presented in clear, 
elegant, and concise prose 
Combination of simple and 
complex sentences; concise; 
precise and accurate use of course 
terms 

Entirely free of syntax, usage,

Question 36.  

Based on Case Study 3: RFP for a Personal Data Management Assistant located in Appendix C, generate Functions, Objectives and Constraints. 
Utilize course tools such as Functional Basis and Functional Decomposition. In total, you should have about 10 items, whether they are Primary 
Functions, Secondary Functions, Unintended Functions, Objectives or Constraints. Treat this like a section of a design document with a section 
introduction and sub-sections. Introduce each of the sub-sections (e.g. Functions, Objectives, Constraints) with a few sentences that help the 
reader understand their nature and significance. (15 marks)  

Component 
Introductory sentences 

Fails (F) 7/15 and below 
Does not introduce lists or 
introduces lists in way 
that is not meaningful 

Below (C, D) 7.5-10/15 
Uses textbook definitions 

Meets (B) 10.5-11.5/15 
Adapts textbook 
definitions to specific 
situation 

Functional basis 

Primary functions 

Secondary functions 

Objectives 

Constraints 

Does not provide 
Functional basis or 
provides incorrect 
functional basis 
Does not correctly identify 
primary function(s) 

Provides partial functional 
basis – e.g. uses verb 
“control” rather than 
specific kind of control 
Identifies one primary 
function 

Provides one functional 
basis according to form, 
likely some form of 
control of information 
Identifies two primary 
functions 

Does not provide relevant 
secondary functions  
Objectives vague and/or 
meaningless 

Provides some relevant 
secondary functions 
Some meaningful 
objectives given 

Misses constraints in 
Client Statement 

Some constraints given 
but may be in terms of 
client statement 

Provides a fairly complete 
list of secondary functions 
All objectives are 
reasonable, not 
necessarily measurable 
All constraints indicated in 
client statement are 
translated into 
engineering language 

Exceed (A) >12/15 
In addition to “meets” 
adds meaningful 
dimensions to 
introductory sentences 
Incorporates functional 
basis in the introduction 
in a meaningful way. 

Identifies primary 
functions, in language 
that moves beyond 
functional basis 
Provides a comprehensive 
list of secondary functions 
Objectives may have goals 
added and seem to be 
measurable 
Constraints from problem 
statement, in engineering 
language, are augmented 
by reasonable other 
constraints (laws, codes) 

 
 
 
Question 37.  

Identify five key research questions you would want to answer in order to check the validity of your claims and to develop the three top 
objectives further. (Don’t worry about whether the questions are open or closed.) (5 marks) 

Like the PSQ assignment:  

• 
•  Can students recognize what they don't know that they need to know 
• 
I.e., Can they identify what additional information they need? 
•  Can they come up with some ideas on where/how to find it? 
•  To get full marks (5/5) only have to meet expectations, not exceed (exam) 

1-1.5 
Provides 1 Q. useful 
for 
validating/developing 
chosen objectives 

2-3 
Provides 1 or 2 questions 
useful for 
validating/developing the 
chosen objectives 

FULL MARKS 4-5/5 
All 5 Qs. target info that 
would validate or 
develop the chosen 
objectives 

FAIL 0/5
