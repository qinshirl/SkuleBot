   The  laboratory  sessions  will  be  held  in  the  Instrumentation  Lab  (GB341).  Each  student  is 
expected to maintain a bound lab book that includes the preparation and documentation of all 
work  done  in  the  laboratory.  The  lab  book  is  to  be  updated  continually  during  each  lab 
session  and  to  include  all  measured  data,  tables,  graphs,  and  descriptions  of  relevant 
measurement techniques, computation, and conclusions.  The lab book will be evaluated by a 
teaching assistant during each lab session. There are five laboratory sessions starting start on 
Friday May 20.  During the first lab session, students will have the option of choosing their 
own lab partners from the same lab section (groups of two students).

  Missed quizzes or laboratories.  If you miss a test or a laboratory session, consideration will 

be given as follows, provided your petition (submitted online) is approved.  
 

If you missed any of the first 4 labs and your petition is approved, then you are provided 
with a makeup lab.  
If you miss lab #5 then your average lab mark will be calculated based on the previous 4 
labs. 
If  you  miss  a  quiz  and  your  petition  is  approved,  your  average  quiz  mark  will  be 
calculated based on the other quizzes. 
If you missed any lab or test without a petition, or your petition is not approved, a zero 
mark will be recorded for that component.
