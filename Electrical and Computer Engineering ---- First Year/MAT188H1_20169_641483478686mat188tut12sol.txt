Hint: There are only two eigenvalues of A, λ1 = 9, and λ2 = 2.

Solution:

Using the hint, we ﬁnd bases for the two eigenspaces E2 and E9. Since A is symmetric, we should have
(E2)⊥ = E9.

4. Let b (cid:54)= 0 and A =

P T AP = D.

Solution:

We begin by ﬁnding the characteristic polynomial of A to determine the eigenvalues of A:

CA(λ) = det(A − λI) = (λ − (a − b))(λ − (a + b))

2 of 3

so that the eigenvalues of A are λ = a ± b. Next, we ﬁnd bases for each of the eigenspaces Ea+b and
Ea−b:

Ea+b = null

is an orthonormal basis for R2 consisting of eigenvectors of A. So, the matrix P with these vectors as
columns is orthogonal and such that

5. Find a and b to ﬁnd the best-ﬁtting equation of the form y = ax + b2x for the set of data points (0, 1),

(1, 3), and (2, 10).

Solution:
If the given points were on the curve y = ax + b2x, then the system

b = 1

a + 2b = 3

2a + 4b = 10

would be consistent. It isn’t, of course, so we ﬁnd the least squares solution to the system Ax = b

where A =
