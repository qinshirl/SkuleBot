Q3 [10 marks]  

a) The rectangle shows the top view of a copper slab of length L and thickness T (thickness T not shown in 
the figure) placed in a uniform magnetic field (
) pointing into the page.  Please note that the copper slab is 
non-deformable. A constant current I is passed through the copper slab from the bottom to the top (wires 
bringing the current into and out of the slab are not shown). Moreover, a voltmeter is connected to the 
rectangular slab at locations labeled C and D. Circle the correct observation listed below and justify your 
answer. (4 marks)

b) Figure below shows a straight metallic wire (in the shape of a cylinder) placed in a uniform magnetic field 
of B = 1.5 T pointing into the page. A current I0 flows through the wire (connections are not shown) and the 
wire is elevated from the floor. If mass density of the wire (ρ
o) is 8920 kg/m3 and wire radius is 0.5 cm, what 
is the magnitude and direction (from left to right or from right to left) of the current needed to keep the wire 
afloat above the floor. (6 marks)
