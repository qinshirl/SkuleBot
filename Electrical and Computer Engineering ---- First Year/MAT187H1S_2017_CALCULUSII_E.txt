PART II. 

11. You are working for Texas Instruments and need to program the function 

(20 Marks) 

arctan(x) into a calculator. The calculator can only add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. 

One way to do it is to use Taylor Series. 

(a) (3 marks) Use a substitution to show that arctan(x) = f  1 

du. 

(b) (7 marks) What is the Taylor series for arctan(x) centred at a = 0? Justify your answer. 

Hint. Recall the geometric series, as given in the formula sheet.

(5 marks) What is the radius of convergence of this series? Justify your answer. 

(5 marks) We want to compute arctan(). How many terms do we have to add to make sure 
that the error is smaller than 28?  Justify your answer. 

Hint.  Once you have an inequality describing the number of terms needed, guess and check 

to find the smallest number of terms that satisfies the inequality.
