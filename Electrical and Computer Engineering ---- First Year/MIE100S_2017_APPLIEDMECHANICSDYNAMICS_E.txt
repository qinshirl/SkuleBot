A wheel of radius R = 0.4 meters rolls to the right on the ground without slipping. At time t=0, 
the angular velocity of the wheel is w = 3 radians/second. The angular acceleration of the 
wheel is a function of the angular velocity, and is given by a = 4w. (All variables are in SI 
units). 
A thin bar BD of length 1.8 meters is pinned at one end to the edge of the wheel; the other end 
of the bar drags along the ground. At time t=0, point D is at the position shown in the diagram, 
point M is at the top of the wheel.

normal-tangential coordinates.

A uniform flat disk "A" of mass MA = 3.5 kg hits a stationary ring "B" of mass mB  = 0.8 kg in 
a perfectly elastic collision.  Both rigid bodies have zero angular velocity just before and after 
the collision. The coefficients of friction between the ground and rigid bodies are: ,u  = 0.3 and 
0.25.  If (i)G  = 4.0 1 m/s before the collision, determine the velocity of the center of 

mass of each body immediately after the collision.

3.  A uniform flat disk "A" of mass m  = 3.5 kg and radius R = 1.3 m is initially at rest at the top 
of a hill. The spring with k = 900 N/rn has a relaxed, undeformed length lo  = 0.8 m, but has 
been compressed to a length 1 = 0.5 in, as shown in the diagram. Note that the spring is not 
attached to the disk. 

____  The spring is released, (i. e.  it returns to its relaxed length), and this causes the disk to roll down 
8 

the hill and eventually reach a flat surface. The entire surface has p, = 0.3 and /.tk  0.25. 
Assume the disk rolls down the hill without slip. Determine the disk's angular velocity w and 
velocity of the centre of mass G, ()G  when it reaches the bottom of the hill.

4. At time t=0, a ring "B" is translating on the ground with ()G = 2.41 m/s and no angular 
velocity (i.e., it is slipping on the surface). How much time does it take for the ring to stop 
slipping, and begin to roll without slipping? The coefficients of friction between the ground 
and rigid bodies are: p, = 0.3 and  uk = 0.25.  The ring "B" has mass mB = 0.8 kg, 
radius R = 0.95 in, and radius of gyration with respect to the center of mass kc, = 0.9 meters.

6. A bar is pinned at one end at point "0", such that it can rotate about a horizontal axis passing 
through "0" as shown in the diagram. A small motor at point "0" forces the bar to have a 
constant angular velocity of w = 3 radians/second. As the bar passes the position 0 = 0, a small 
block B of mass 0.1 kg is placed on the bar at a distance of 0.45 meters from "0". 
The mass starts to slip on the bar when 0 reaches 50 degrees. Determine the value of the

the bar. The motor forces the bar to have an angular velocity of  U)  = 3 radians/second as the 
bar passes the position 0 = 0, and forces co  to increase at a constant rate of 
1.9 radians/second2. As the bar passes the position 0 = 0, a small block W of mass 0.1 kg is 
placed on the bar at a distance of 0.45 meters from "0". The coefficient of static friction 
between W and the bar is equal to p.  0.60. 

F___  Draw a free body diagram of block W when 0 is equal to 35 degrees. Indicate the direction of 

each force on the free body diagram, and determine the magnitude of each force. (You may 
assume that block B is not slipping).

8.  The system shown consists of a spring, pulley and long slender rod of length L = 5  meters and 
mass m = 3 kg. There is a spring with stiffness k = 250 N/rn attached to the rod as shown in 
the diagram. The rope is being pulled by a force F(t). 

Ignore the mass of the pulleys. Assume that the system is in static equilibrium when the bar is 
horizontal (0 = 0) and F(t) = 0. Assume that the rope does not stretch and it does not go slack. 
Assume that oscillation amplitudes are very small.

9.  A pendulum consists of a small sphere B of mass 10 kg, attached to a bar in the shape of a "T" 

which is pinned at 0 and has negligible mass. The T-shaped bar is composed of a horizontal bar of 
length 4 meters, welded to one vertical bar of length 2 meters. The horizontal bar is connected to 
two ceiling supports by two identical springs of stiffness k= 155 N/m, and two dashpots (dampers) 
. The springs are relaxed, and the angular orientation 0 of the bar is zero 
of strength c = 20 
when the vertical bar hangs straight down and sphere B is aligned directly under the pin at 0 as 
shown in the diagram.
