PART I

No explanation is necessary.

(6 marks)

1. The sequence

(cid:27)

(cid:26) sin(n)
n

is

convergent

/

divergent .

(circle the correct option)

2. The integral tests states that if f (k) = ak > 0 where f is a continuous and decreasing function for

x (cid:62) 1, then

∞
(cid:88)

k=1

ak converges if and only if

3. We can write f (x) =

1
1 + x

=

(7 Marks)

(when it stops ﬂickering, it means that it burned out).
