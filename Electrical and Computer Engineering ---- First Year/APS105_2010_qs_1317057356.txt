Computer Fundamentals

Tuesday, October 12

All quizzes, tests, and exams in this course are closed book with no calculators.

[10 Marks] Write a complete C program that prompts the user for a positive integer using the
message “Give a positive integer:” and computes:

• the number of odd integers between zero and the user provided integer (inclusive)

• the sum of these odd integers

• the average of these odd integers

Your program should output two lines (other than the prompt):

• the ﬁrst line lists the odd integers between zero and the user provided integer (inclusive),

each separated by a space

• the second line lists the three quantities computed, in the order given above, each separated

by a comma

Here is an example output from the execution of the program:

Give a positive integer:10
1 3 5 7 9
5, 25, 5

Note 1: Your program can assume the input is valid (i.e., a positive integer).

Note 2: Your program should not make use of arrays.

Place your solution on the back of this page.

Your Solution:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{

int num, n = 0, count = 0, sum = 0, avg = 0;

// Prompt user and read input
printf("Give a positive integer: ");
scanf("%d", &num);

// Check all numbers up to num
while(n <= num){

// Check if it is odd
if( n % 2 != 0){

printf("%d ", n);
count++;
sum = sum + n;

// Print it
// Count it
// Sum it up

}
n++;

}
printf("\n");

if(count > 0){

// Change line

avg = sum / count;

// Compute average

}

printf("%d, %d, %d\n", count, sum, avg);// Print values

return 0;

}
