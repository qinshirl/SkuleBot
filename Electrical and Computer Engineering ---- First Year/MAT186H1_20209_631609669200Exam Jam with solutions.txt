Riemann Sums

A box of 100 kilograms of sand is being pulled up a distance of 50
meters. The motion occurs at a constant rate over the course of one
minute. The sand is leaking from the box at a rate of 1 kilogram per
second. The box itself weighs 5 kilograms. Write and justify a deﬁnite
integral expression for the amount of work done pulling the box up.

Differential Equations

A population of rabbits, left without predators, grows at a rate equal to 10% of the current
rabbit population per month. To help keep the population in check, we take rabbits out
of the wild to allow students to pet them before ﬁnals. We do this at a constant rate of 25
rabbits per month. We started off with 300 rabbits in the population.

(a) Write a differential equation modeling the number of rabbits over time.

b) Are there any equilibrium solutions to this equation?

(c) Use the initial condition to write an initial value problem. What happens to the population
of rabbits over time? Explain how you know.

Word Problems ⇔ Mathematical Expressions

A pickup truck is being used to transport sand. Let the time t be given in hours.
Sand is leaking from a truck bed; there’s 100 kg to start, and the rate of change of
sand in the truck is L(t) kilograms per hour. The fuel efficiency of this pickup truck
is F (m) miles per gallon, where m is the mass of sand in the pickup track. Assume
both functions are differentiable and that F (m) is invertible with inverse function m(F ).

1. When the fuel efficiency is 30 mi/gal, the mass of sand in the truck is half of what
it is when the fuel efficiency is 20 mi/gal. Represent this statement with a single
mathematical equation.
