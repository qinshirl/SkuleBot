3. Graph the function f(x) = x 3  + 3x2  - 3x + I6x + 61. 

Organize your solution well. 
Include all of the important values (one, in particular, requires a detailed 
analysis) and identify their type (maximum, minimum, etc.). 
Indicate regions where the function is increasing vs. decreasing, concave 
up vs. concave down. 
You have two pages for this problem.

4. Let f(x) = ex ,  for x :5 0. For any point on the graph, the tangent line will 
meet both the x and y axes, creating a triangle. Find the point that 
maximizes the area of this triangle. 

(Hint: Start with a general point, (a, e°), find its tangent line, and calculate its 

intersections with the axes.).

5. A lamp of height 8 feet is standing on one side of a narrow street. On the opposite 

side, a 6 foot tall person is walking at a rate of 3 feet per second. If the street is 8 
feet across, how fast is the person's shadow lengthening two seconds after 
walking directly across from the lamp?

6. A trench is created in the shape of a triangle rotated about an axis. If we 

consider the ground to be the x - axis, then the triangle has coordinates 
(-4,0), (-1,0), and (-3, —2) and the axis of rotation is x = 2. 
How much water is needed to fill the trench? 
How much work is required to do so, if the water source is a pump three 
metres below the ground?
