1.  A box of mass m = 50 kg slides down a hill. At the instant before it goes over the cliff 
(Position A in the diagram), the speed of the box is 17 m/s, the frictional force between 
the box and hill is 130 Newtons, the radius of curvature of the hill is 28 meters, and the 
hill is sloped down at 20 degrees.

2.  Crates A and B are connected by a rope and pulley system. At the instant shown in the 

diagram, the speed of crate A is 0.5 m/s to the right.  The coefficient of kinetic friction µk 
between the crate A and the ground is 0.27.   

massA = 44 kg.   massB = 21 kg. 

(10 marks)  

(a)  What is the kinetic energy of crate B at the instant shown in the diagram? 

(20 marks)

3.         Collars A and B slide on a frictionless rod as shown in the diagram. At the instant shown, 
collar B has a velocity of 2 m/s to the left, and collar A is sitting at rest on two platforms. 
The platforms are each attached to a spring and are initially held stationary with the 
springs compressed to an initial length x = 0.3 m, as shown. Each spring has an 
unstretched (relaxed) length of 1.5 m and a spring constant of 200 N/m. The mass of 
collar A is 4 kg and the mass of collar B is 5 kg. Assume that the dimensions of both 
collars and the platforms are extremely small.  

(10 marks)  

(a)  What is the total elastic potential energy of the two springs before the platforms 

are released? 

(20 marks)  

(b)  When the platforms are released, collar A slides along the rod to point C where it 
collides with collar B. The two collars then stick together. What is the velocity of 
collars A and B immediately after they stick together, expressed in x-y coordinates? 

(10 marks)  

(c) 

How much heat is generated in the collision between collars A and B?
