LABORATORY GUIDELINES 

Objectives: 

•  To  master  the  use  of  fundamental  laboratory  equipment,  such  as,  DC  power  supply,  function 

generator, digital multimeter, and oscilloscope. 

•  To  verify  experimentally,  through  the  use  of  basic  measurement  techniques,  the  behavior  of 

various individual electrical circuits studied in the lectures. 

Each student is expected: 

•  To  maintain  a  bound  (i.e.  no  loose  sheets)  laboratory  lab-book  that  includes  preparations  and 
documents of all work done in the laboratory.  The Physics Lab-book sold at the UofT bookstore 
is highly recommended. You are not required to have a new one – you can continue to use one 
from  an  earlier  course  if  you  wish.  The  preparation  includes  a  brief  description  of  the 
experimental procedures in your own words. Always write in pen, never in pencil, into the lab-
book,  and  never  use  white-out.  If  a  mistake  is  found,  it  should  be  neatly  crossed  out  and 
corrections added in pen. The lab-book is to be updated continually during each experiment and 
to include all measured data, tables, graphs and descriptions of relevant measurement techniques, 
computations, and conclusions. The graphs and tables in the instruction sheets are samples only 
and should be copied by hand into the lab book. 

•  To review the operating instructions for DC power supply, digital multimeter, function generator 
and  oscilloscope,  and  to  read  notes  on  conventions  for  protoboard  and  resistors  use  in  the 
laboratory (“APPENDICES” posted on the course web site). 

•  To arrive on time and be well prepared at the beginning of each laboratory session. A complete 
preparation includes, aside from a description of the procedures, completion of the preparatory 
assignment for the experiment. 

•  To  finish  all  parts  of  the  experiment  on  time.  To  achieve  this,  thorough  preparatory  work  is 

critical. 

Other guidelines: 

•  No food or drink inside the laboratory 

•  Keep the laboratory neat and clean, and return items to their original locations at the completion 

of each lab session.

Objectives: 

i) 

ii) 

To learn how to operate the basic equipment (DMM, oscilloscope, protoboard etc.). 

To become familiar with the measurement techniques used in the study of DC and AC circuits. 

There are three important rules that should be followed in laboratory practice: 

Rule 1:  Any signal (voltage or current) must be adjusted to the specified amplitude and frequency 

before it is applied to a circuit. 

Rule 2:  A measuring instrument must be set up for the required mode of operation before it is 

connected to a circuit. 

Rule 3:  The power supply must be switched off before making any changes to the circuit connections. 

Components:  a 1 kΩ resistor and several resistors of random values 

To  become  familiar  with  the  laboratory  equipment,  follow  all  instructions  in  parts  EE.1 
through EE.5. 

PART EE.1 – Resistor Color Code: 

•  To get familiar with the resistor color code. 

Procedure: 

The resistance of a resistor determines how much current it will carry when a given voltage is applied 
across it.  A resistor’s resistance is specified by a color code on the resistor. Identify and write down the 
color code of the resistors provided, then determine their resistances using the table on the next page. 
You should learn the resistor color code before performing Experiment #3.

Voltage Measurement

Step 2:  Select an appropriate range (7)  for reading voltages of about 10V. 

Step 3:  Identify the DC power supply on your workbench. Two power supply models, the GW-Instek 
GPS-3303 and the HP Model 6218, are shown on the next page. The GPS-3303 can be used as 
two independent power supplies.

Step 4:  Push the power button or switch (1). If you are using the GPS-3303 make sure both tracking 

mode switches (14) are “out”, i.e. disengaged.  

Step 5:  Connect the free plug of the two-wire lead that you connected to the DMM to the output of the 
DC power supply according to Figure EE.1 on the next page and as shown below. For the HP 
Model 6218A the output voltage appears between the (+) and (-) terminals (8) for the GPS-
3303 between the (+) and (-) terminals of (10) or (11) depending on if CH1 or CH2 is used. If 
you are using the GPS-3303 push in the output button (15) – the output indicator light should 
be on. 

Step 6:  Adjust the applied voltage V of the DC power supply to +10V using the DMM reading. Try 

different range settings. Which is the BEST range and why? 

Question: Are the voltage readings on the DMM and on the power supply in reasonable 

agreement?

In step5, you will learn how to use a protoboard to build a circuit. 

Step 7:  Connect the circuit with the hook-up wires shown in Figure EE.2 on the previous page.  Rows 
and columns of “dots” that are electrically connected are indicated by the solid lines in Figure 
EE.2. Check to be sure that the wirings (dotted lines) are done as shown in the diagram.  
Report to a teaching assistant if there is any missing BNC connection on the protoboard.

PART EE.3 – DC Current Measurement: 

Purpose 

•  To learn how to use the DMM as an ammeter to measure DC current in a circuit. 

Procedure: 

• 

In this exercise you will build a circuit with one resistor 

Step 1:  Set up the DC power supply to +10V and the other DMM to the DC current mode of operation, 

i.e. push in the “mA” function key (5), making sure that (2) and (3) are not pushed in, and 
connect a double-banana lead as shown below:  

Input Terminals
"mA" and "COM"

Function
Switch "mA"

Current Measurement

Step 2:  Select the appropriate range.  (Hint: the current you will measure should be about 10 mA). 

Step 3:  Connect the circuit as shown in Figure EE.3 on the next page, using hook-up wires and both 

DMMs as shown. This way the voltage across and the current through the resistor can be 
measured simultaneously. 

Step 4:  Measure the current I in the 1 kΩ resistor using the range that gives the most precise reading.  

Is the current reading positive or negative?  What is the effect of reversing the connection to 
the ammeter? 

Step 5:  Change the voltage across the resistor R to -10V. This is obtained by reversing the polarity of 

the DC power supply.  Measure and record the voltage across and the current through the 
resistor.

Step 2:  Turn on the power by pushing the Power button and press AUTOSET (2). You should see two 
traces, i.e. horizontal lines, on the display. If you do not see two traces, push the CH 1 MENU 
button (4) once, then AUTOSET (2) again. Should you still see only one trace, push the CH 2 
MENU button (8) once, then AUTOSET (2) again. 

Step 3:  Push the CH 1 MENU (4) button once. Check the right hand side of the display for the probe 
attenuation (PROBE). It should read 10X. If PROBE does not read 10X push the softkey (13) 
next to PROBE on the display repeatedly until it reads 10X. Check the oscilloscope probes if 
one or both have an attenuation switch. If so, make sure they are set to 10X as well 

Step 4:  Use the Position dial for CH 1 (3) to vertically align the trace with the center graticule line. 
Push CH 2 MENU (8) repeatedly until the second trace disappears. The oscilloscope is now 
set up to measure one waveform in CH 1.

Step 5:  Identify the function generators, models GFG8016G and GFG-813, shown below, on your 
workbench. Select one to set up for your experiment. Refer to these figures when setting up 
one of them for 6 V peak-to-peak sinusoidal waveform, i.e. the amplitude of the sinusoid is 3 
V, with a frequency of 1 kHz.

Step 6:  Push in the power switch (1). Push in the “~” function switch (2) and the 1 kHz frequency 

multiplier switch (3). Adjust the frequency dial (4) until the LED display (6) reads 1.0 kHz. 

Step 7:  Push the EXT/INT selector (5) out. If using the GFG8016G model push in the DUTY control 
(7), move it to the CAL position, and make sure that the Amplitude control (8) is pushed in. If 
using the GFG-813 make sure that both attenuation switches (12) are pushed out. Do not adjust 
the amplitude yet, this will be done in Part EE.5, using the oscilloscope. 

Step 8:  Connect a BNC-BNC cable to the waveform output BNC connector (10), labeled “MAIN” on 

the GFG-813 model and “50Ω” on the GFG8016G model

PART EE.5 – Measurement Using the Oscilloscope: 

Purpose: 

•  To measure the amplitude of periodic signals using an oscilloscope. 

Procedure: 

Step 1:  After setting up the oscilloscope and the function generator as specified in Part EE.4, connect 

the waveform to one of the BNC connectors on the protoboard as shown in Figure EE.4. 
Identify the column of “dots” on the protoboard the signal is connected to.

  Note:  Always use the oscilloscope probes, not BNC-BNC cables, to connect signals to CH1 or CH2 

of the oscilloscope. 

Step 2:  Use a hook-up wire to connect the probe to the signal and connect the long lead to the ground 

terminal as shown: 

Step 3:  On the oscilloscope, the vertical (voltage) and horizontal (time) scales are shown as voltage per 

division and time per division at the bottom of the oscilloscope display. Use the VOLTS/DIV 
dial for CH1 (5) and the SEC/DIV dial (12) to set the vertical scale to 1V and the horizontal 
scale to 250 μs: 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4:  Adjust the output voltage of the function generator to 6 V peak-to-peak by using the Amplitude 
Control (8), while observing the oscilloscope display.  Once the amplitude is adjusted 
correctly, the waveform should look like this:. 

Step 5:  Draw the voltage waveform as seen on the screen.  Record the VOLT/DIV, and TIME/DIV 

settings. 

Before leaving the lab room: 

•  Disassemble the circuits, return the components and the connection cables to the allocated 

areas, and switch off the main power switch (on the gray metal panel). 

•  Make appropriate comments and observations in your lab book and have the book checked 

and signed by the Teaching Assistant assigned to you. 

The techniques learned in this experiment will be used in subsequent laboratory sessions.  
Make sure that you understand how to use the equipment.

Experiment #1  

  Electrical Charge                                        

Objectives: 

i) 

ii) 

To demonstrate that there are two types of electric charges in nature.  

To compare the electrostatic properties of insulating and conducting materials.  

Instrument:  Wimshurst Electrostatic Generator 

Preparation: 

Study the instruction sheets for this experiment. In your lab book, write down in your own words and 
short-point form notes the procedures for each part. 

PART 1.1 – TRIBOELECTRIC SCALE: 

Purpose: To show through qualitative observations the following phenomena: 

−  Separation of electric charges by friction, 
−  Existence of two types of charges (+ and -), 
−  Existence of electrostatic forces between charged objects (Coulomb’s law), 
−  Categorization of materials based on the “triboelectric1” effect. 

Description: 

Objects  are  usually  electrically  neutral;  they  contain  equal  amounts  of  positive  and  negative  charge.  
Neutral objects neither attract nor repel each other electrically.  Their balance of charge can be upset by 
rubbing or by the presence of other nearby charges (charging by induction). 
In this exercise the attractive and/or repulsive electric forces between charged objects will be observed 
using  the  needle  point  support  setup  shown  in  Figure  1.1.    You  will  confirm  the  presence  of  electric 
charges and forces exerted by these charges.  You will also classify various materials according to the 
triboelectric  properties.    The  triboelectric  properties  of  materials  are  summarized  in  the  triboelectric 
series, which is a list of materials, arranged so that if a material placed low on the list is rubbed with a 
material  that  is  higher  on  the  list,  the  higher  placed  material  will  become  positively  charged  and  the 
lower placed material will become negatively charged. 

Procedure: 

Step 1: Rub  both  ends  of  a  coloured  plastic  straw  with  the  fur  cloth.    This  will  charge  the  straw 
negatively.    Balance  the  charged  straw  on  the  needle-point  support.    Next,  charge  one  end  of  a 
second coloured plastic straw in the same way and hold it close to the first straw.  Note the nature 
(attractive or repulsive) and magnitude, (strong or weak) of the force exerted on the straw in the 
support.    What  rule  have  you  confirmed?    Note  that  technique  is  critical  here  and  you  should 
discharge  yourself  by  touching  the  bare  metal  plate  (not  its  painted  surface)  at  the  back  of  the 
bench. 

1 The word “triboelectric” comes from the Greek word tribos, which means “rubbing”, therefore electricity 
produced by rubbing.

Step 2: Discharge  the  second  straw  and  recharge 
it  by  rubbing  it  with  the  green  felt  cloth.  
Hold  it  close  to  the  fur-charged  straw 
balanced in the needle-point support.  Note 
the  nature  and  magnitude  of  the  force 
exerted on the straw in the support.  What 
type  of  triboelectric  charge  is  on  the  felt-
rubbed straw? 

Figure 1.1  Needle-point support set-up 

Step 3: Discharge the coloured straw in the stand 
and  recharge  it  by  rubbing  with  the  felt 
cloth.    Then  charge  one  end  of  the  clear 
plastic  rod  with  the  felt  as  well.    Observe 
the electrostatic forces.  What type of triboelectric charge is on the clear plastic rubbed by the felt 
cloth? 

Step 4: Finally, discharge the clear plastic rod and recharge it using the fur.  Leave the coloured plastic 

straw, already charged with the felt, in the support.  Observe the forces as before. 

Step 5: From  the  results  of  the  previous  three  steps,  define  the  order  of  the  four  materials  used  in  the 

triboelectric scale. 

The procedure in steps 1 through 4 was designed to demonstrate the triboelectric effects causing charge 
separation.  The method used was based on observations of the force between two charged objects.  In 
step 6 you will observe the force between a charged object and a neutral (uncharged) object. 

Step 6: Touch the metal panel (not the painted surface) at the back of the bench to ensure that your body 
is not charged.  Then remove all the charge on the two coloured straws by holding them closely 
together in your hands until they show no electrostatic forces when one is placed on the needle-
point support and the other is brought nearby.  Leaving one neutral straw in the support, charge 
the  other  straw  by  rubbing  with  felt  or  fur.    Why  is  the  neutral  straw  attracted  to  the 
triboelectrically charged straw?  Explain the phenomenon.  Discuss how this effect could lead you 
to draw the wrong conclusions in step 5. 

PART 1.2 – WIMSHURST MACHINE: 

Purpose: 
i) 
ii) 

To become familiar with the Wimshurst machine. 
To observe the storage and transfer of charge using Leyden jars. 

Description: 

A more efficient method of separating electric charges is accomplished using the Wimshurst machine, a 
few rotations should be sufficient to produce a spark.  If this fails, get help from an instructor. 

Procedure: 

Step 1:  Six Wimshurst machines are available in the laboratory, and they will have to be shared among 
several teams. To transfer the charges to your own station, bring the two Leyden jars labeled (+) 
and  (-)  to  the  Wimshurst  machine  and  collect  the  charge  from  the  discharge-spheres.  A  few 
rotations should be sufficient to produce a spark.  If this fails, get help from an instructor. Have a 
Teaching Assistant show you how to transfer the charges safely.  

17 

 
 
 
 
 
Step 2:  To  verify  that  you  actually  have  collected  two  types  of  charges,  use  the  needle-point  support 
set-up  from  PART  1.1.    Charge  the  plastic  straw  negatively  and  place  it  in  the  support.    Then 
charge a metallized Ping-Pong ball by touching one of the charged Leyden jars.  Bring the ball 
close to the straw and observe the force on the straw.  Is the polarity sign on the jar-label correct?  
Repeat using the other Leyden jar. 

Triboelectric Charging 

Taken from Morse, R.A., Teaching about Electrostatics, AAPT (1992) p.3-1 
When  two  materials  with  different  affinities  for  positive  and  negative  charges  are  rubbed  together  or 
separated, one may end up with an excess of negative charge and the other with an excess of positive 
charge, giving the materials net negative and positive charges. This will occur to some extent with any 
two materials, but the results may not be obvious unless the materials are good inculators. This process 
is called triboelectric charging. 
The  actual  mechanisms  of  contact  charging  are  complex,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  materials, 
surface  impurities,  moisture,  etc.,  and  may  involve  both  motion  of  electrons  and  ions.  The  contact 
between  dissimilar  surfaces  seems  to  be  the  important  feature,  with  rubbing  acting  to  increase  the 
number of contact points. (See Science, 256 (5055), p.362, Apr. 17. 1992).  
Several  experimenters  have  established  lists  of  materials  and  their  relative  affinities  for  negative  and 
positive charge when rubbed together. Such a list is called a triboelectric series. An example of such a 
series is given below.

Wimshurst Machine 

Fig. A-23  James Wimshurst original design. (Electrical Influence Machines, John Gray, 1903) 

The  Wimshurst  machine,  shown  in  Fig.  A-23,  provides  an  efficient  method  of  separating  electric 
charges by induction and not by friction; it is an electrostatic generator capable of throwing long sparks 
between two discharge-spheres mounted on swivel arms when Leyden jars are connected to them.  This 
machine  consists  of  two  parallel  non-  conductive  discs,  hand  driven  so  that  they  rotate  in  opposite 
directions about a common axis. Each plate  has narrow metal  strips arranged radially, equal distances 
apart  around  the  rim.  Two  brushes  connected  to  metal  rods,  one  in  front  and  one  in  back,  transfer 
charges from one side of a disc to the other.  Other metal brushes collect these charges and store them in 
two  (+)  and  (-)  Leyden  jars.    Attached  to  these  jars  are  metal  rods  with  discharge  spheres  at  the  end. 
When enough charge is collected in the jars and the electric field between the discharge-spheres exceeds 
the dielectric strength of the air, a spark jumps between the spheres discharging the jars. The Wimshurst 
machine requires an initial charge separation on the plates.  This can be created triboelectrically and will 
be amplified as the plates rotate.   

CAUTION 

The  Wimshurst  electrostatic  generators  used  in  this  laboratory  produce  voltages  of  50,000  to 
100,000 Volts.  They are used to charge Leyden jars with up to 0.000001 Coulombs of electric charge.  
If  you  discharge  a  charged  Leyden  jar  through  your  body  you  will  experience  a  painful  shock.    You 
probably have experienced similar static shocks when you shuffle your feet on a rug on a dry day.  You 
would receive a more severe shock from a car's ignition system.  Your hand may feel numb for several 
minutes afterward but there will be no other negative effects or any other danger from the shock.  To 
avoid this painful experience, use one hand only and grasp the Leyden jar at the end far from the pop 
can. 

IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION OR A HEART PACEMAKER, HOWEVER, 
IT WOULD BE WISE NOT TO HANDLE THE LEYDEN JARS AT ALL.

Time  Saver:  The  experiment  consists  of  3  parts.  Since  there  will  be  some  sharing  of 
equipment/components involved, roughly half of the groups should start with Part 2.2, and then Part 2.3, 
and finally Part 2.1. The remaining groups can proceed with the usual sequence.  

PART 2.1 (Qualitative) Magnetic Force on a Current: 

Purpose: 

Determine the direction of the magnetic field by observing its force on a current-carrying wire. 

Description: 

A thin wire is placed between two closely spaced magnets as shown in Fig. 2.1. The magnets are placed 
such that the north pole of one magnet is facing the south pole of the other. However, the magnets are 
not labeled. Your task is to determine which one is the north pole.  

Initially, there is no current going through the wire, and wire remains stationary. By applying a current 
to the wire, and carefully observing the movement of the wire right after the current is turned on, you 
can  determine  the  direction  of  the  force  exerted  on  the  wire  by  the  magnetic  field  created  by  the 
magnets.  You  can  also  find  out  the  direction  of  the  current  by  tracing  the  circuit  used  to  apply  the 
current to the wire. As a result, you can determine which pole is the north pole.

resistor is connected in series with the wire but hidden from view. 

Procedure: 

Step 1: Set up the DC power supply appropriately (see below), but DO NOT connect it to the circuit yet.  

If you are using a GPS-3303 power supply, turn on the DC power supply, but DO NOT enable 
the output yet. Make sure that you set the voltage to 6.0V and set the current limit to 0.15A. 

If you are using a PC-2405 or HP6218A power supply, do not connect the circuit to the power 
supply  yet.  First, 
to  6.0 
V. Set the current to minimum. Then, connect the circuit to the power supply, turn on the power 
supply. Slowly turn up the current until the green LED under C.V. is lit. Now, turn off the power 
supply.

Step  2:  If  you  are  using  a  GPS-3303  power  supply,  before  enabling  the  output,  connect  the  power

supply by pressing the “output” button. How does the wire move when the current is applied? 
(Note: the movement is minute, and requires very close observation.) 

If  you  are  using  a  PC-2405  or  HP6218A  power  supply,  turn  off  the  power  supply  and  then 
connect  it  to  the  circuit  without  turning  it  on.  While  closely  observing  the  wire,  turn  on  the 
power  supply. How  does the wire move  when the  current is applied? (Note: the movement is 
minute, and requires very close observation.) 

Step 3: While closely observing the wire, disable or turn off the output of the DC power supply. Which 

way does the wire move when the current is cut off? 

Step 4: Repeat Step 3 and 4 if necessary, until all members in the group have observed the movement of 

the wire and agreed with each other regarding the direction of the movement.  

Step 5: Draw a diagram on your lab book, indicating the magnets, the wire, the direction of the current, 
and the direction of the movement of the wire when current is applied.  Then, indicate the north 
and the south pole of the magnets on the diagram.  

PART 2.2 (Quantitative) Inductance of a Solenoid: 

Purpose: 

Determine the relationship between the inductance of a solenoid and its physical dimensions. 

Description: 

In  class,  you  have  learnt  that  the  inductance  of  an  ideal  solenoid  is  determined  only  by  its  physical 
parameters, namely, its length (l), cross-sectional area (A), and the number of turns per unit length (n). 
The formula given in the textbook (30-30) is: 

L

0μ=

2
lAn

(2-1) 

In this part of the experiment, you will verify the above relationship with real solenoids (test coils).  

Note: A set of seven test coils (with serial numbers 11006.01 – 11006.07), shown in Fig. 2.2, is shared 

by two neighbouring stations. Six LCR meters are shared among all lab groups. 

 Figure 2.2 Test coils

Procedure: 

Step 1:  As  part  of  lab preparation, you are asked to fill out Column 5, 6, and 7 in Table 2-1. The coil 
length  l,  was  measured  using  a  ruler  or  a  caliper  (See  Fig.2.3)  and  results  are  provided  in 
Column 2. The coil diameter (Dia.) and the total number of turns (N) are printed on the plastic 
end  cap  (Fig.  2.4),  and  provided  here  in  Column  3  and  4,  respectively.  Calculate  the  cross-
sectional area A (Column 5) and the turns per meter n (Column 6) for each coil. Calculate L in 
Column 7 using Eq. 2-1 given above.  

Step 2: Measure the inductance of the test coils using one of the LCR meters provided. Fill out Column

PART 2.3 (Quantitative) Induction: 

Purpose: 

Observe the phenomenon of magnetic induction between two coils, and measure the induced voltage. 

Description: 

In  this  part  of  the  experiment,  a  large  field  coil  (Fig.  2.5)  is  used  to  generate  a  sinusoidally  varying 
magnetic field. If one of the test coils (used in Part 2.2) is inserted into the hollow cavity of the field 
coil, the varying magnetic field will induce an emf E, described by Faraday’s law:  

−=E

N

d
BΦ

(2-3) 

where N is the total number of turns in the test coil, and ΦB is the magnetic flux inside the coil. Your 
task is to measure this induced emf for various test coils.  

Procedure: 

Figure 2.5 The large field coil 

Step 1:  As part of lab preparation, you are asked to fill out Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2-2. Column 3 is 

the same as Column 5 in Table 2-1.   

Step 2:  Set the function generator to output a sinusoidal waveform of frequency 100 kHz.  

Step 3:  Connect the Function Generator (FG) output to Ch. 1 of the oscilloscope. Observe the output 
waveform of the FG on the oscilloscope. (You need to set up the oscilloscope appropriately to 
observe a stable waveform of a few cycles.) Adjust the amplitude of the FG output to be 10V 
peak-to-peak.  

Step 4:  Connect the large field coil to the output of the FG. You may observe the FG output on the 

oscilloscope at the same time.  

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5:  Connect a pair of long cables to one of the test coils. It is preferable that the other end of the 

cable is terminated with a BNC connector, such that it is convenient to be connected to the 
oscilloscope.  

Step 6:  Observe the induced emf of the test coil on Ch.2 of the oscilloscope while inserting the test coil 

slowly into the hollow cavity of the field coil.  

Step 7:  Record the maximum induced emf in Column 5 of Table 2-2.  

Step 8:  Plot the induced emf versus (N⋅A) on your lab book. What conclusion can you draw from this 
plot? Is this conclusion consistent with the induction theory you learnt in class? Why? 

Step 9: Bonus – Calculate the magnetic field B inside the large field coil and complete Column 6 of 

Table 2-2. Calculate the average B and its standard deviation.

  DC Circuits                                               

Objective: 

To study the relationships among voltage, current and resistance, in DC circuits 

Components:  510 Ω, 5.1 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 100 kΩ resistors 

Preparation: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

Study the instructions for this experiment. In your lab book, write the point form procedures, 
using your own words, and prepare all tables required for this experiment. 

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.1.  Calculate the current I, and the voltages VR1 and VR2, 
assuming that input resistance of the ammeter is zero and that of the voltmeter is infinity.  Enter 
your results into Table 3.2, in your lab book. 

Draw a simplified diagram of the actual physical layout of the circuit including the protoboard, 
instruments and connecting wires, similar to Figure EE.3 from Introductory Lab.  Trace the 
current flow in the circuit using a highlighter. 

PART 3.1 – DC MEASUREMENT: 

Purpose: 

*  Measurement of DC voltage, DC current, and resistance. 

Procedure: 

Step 1:  List the equipment used in this experiment in Table 3.1. 

Step 2:  Set up the two DMMs and the DC power supply as follows: 

*  Set one of the DMMs to the DC voltage mode of operation (to be used as a voltmeter) 

*  Set the other DMM to the DC current mode of operation (to be used as an ammeter) 

*  Set the DC power supply to +10.00 V (using the DMM to check for accuracy) 

Step 3:  Connect the circuit shown in Figure 3.1 on the protoboard using the prepared diagram from 

your preparation.  Do not connect the voltmeter to the circuit yet. 

Step 4:  Connect the power to the protoboard.  Measure the current, I, and the voltages, VR1 and VR2.  

Enter the values into Table 3.2.

Step 5:  Compare the computed and measured values.  List all the possible reasons as to why the 

measured and computed values may not be exactly the same. 

Step 6:  Disassemble the circuit. 

Step 7:  Set one of the DMMs to the resistance mode of operation (to be used as an ohmmeter). 

Step 8:  Measure the resistance of R1 and R2 in turn using the ohmmeter.  The resistors must be 

disconnected from the rest of the circuit before making the measurement.  Enter the measured 
values into Table 3.2. 

Step 9:  Re-compute the values of I, VR1 and VR2 in the circuit of Figure 3.1 using the measured values 

of R1 and R2.  Comment on the results. 

PART 3.2 – INTERNAL RESISTANCE OF A PRACTICAL AMMETER: 

Purpose: 

*  To observe the effect of a practical ammeter on voltage and current measurements. 

  Note:  When calculating the voltage and the current in Part 3.1, it was assumed that the ammeter and 
the voltmeter were ideal instruments.  An ideal ammeter has a zero input resistance, so it has a 
zero voltage drop across it when current passes through the meter.  However, a practical 
ammeter has finite input resistance (typically between 0.1 Ω and 100 Ω, depending on the 
range selected). 

Procedure: 

Step 1:  Set the power supply to +10.00 V. 

Step 2:  Connect the circuit shown in Figure 3.2 on the protoboard, but do not connect the voltmeter to 

the circuit yet. 

Step 3:  Close the switch and measure the loop current, I, using the range that gives the most precise 

reading, as indicated in Table 3.3. 

Step 4:  Connect the voltmeter across the ammeter and measure the voltage, VmA across the ammeter.

Step 6:  Replace the 510Ω resistor with a 5.1 kΩ resistor and repeat the measurements outlined in steps 

3, 4 and 5. 

Step 7:  Now, replace the 5.1 kΩ resistor with a 100 kΩ resistor and repeat the measurements outlined 

in steps 3, 4 and 5. 

Step 8:  Comment on the results and write your conclusions by answering the following questions: 

1.  What percentage of the input voltage, V, is lost across the ammeter? 
2.  Is the input resistance of the ammeter dependent on the measurement range selected? 
3.  Consider a circuit with a power supply, Vs connected in series with a resistor R. 
Choose the most suitable range on the ammeter to measure the current in the circuit if 
(a) Vs = 0.1 V and R = 1 kΩ  (b) Vs = 10 V and R = 100 kΩ. 

PART 3.3 – INPUT RESISTANCE OF A PRACTICAL VOLTMETER: 

Purpose: 

*  To observe the loading effect of a practical voltmeter in a circuit. 

  Note:  An ideal voltmeter has an infinite input resistance, which means that it behaves like an open 
circuit, draws no current, and thus has no loading effect on the circuit. However, a practical 
voltmeter has a finite input resistance (typically around 10 MΩ for a digital multimeter). 

Procedure: 

Step 1:  Set the power supply to +10.00 V. 

Step 2:  Connect the circuit shown in Figure 3.3 on the protoboard.  Measure the voltage, VR across the 

resistor and the loop current, I1. 

Step 3:  Disconnect the voltmeter from the circuit and measure the current, I2.  The difference, I1 - I2 

constitutes the current drawn by the voltmeter.  Which current is larger, I1 or I2?  Explain. 

Step 4:  Record the measured data in a table similar to Table 3.4, and compute the input resistance of 

the voltmeter Riv using the relationship:

Preparation: 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

Study the instruction sheets for each part of this experiment and review the material relating to 
the transient response of RC Circuits. 

In your lab book write the point form procedures, using your own words, and prepare all tables 
required for this experiment. 

Draw a diagram of the actual physical layout of the circuit shown in Figure 4.3, including the 
protoboard, instruments and connecting wires. 

iv) 

Fill in the theoretically expected values missing in Table 4.1 (refer to Figure 4.3) 

PART 4.1 – Waveforms and AC Measurement: 

Purpose: 

*  To measure the frequency and the period of periodic signals using an oscilloscope. 

Procedure: 

Step 1:  Set up the front panel controls of the oscilloscope and the function generator, following the 

instructions given in sections 5 and 6 of the Appendix. 

Step 2:  Connect the output voltage of the function generator to CH1 of the oscilloscope (using the 

protoboard) as shown in Figure 4.1. 

Step 3:  Set the voltage level on the function generator to 6 Vp-p sine wave, and adjust the frequency 

setting, so that the frequency dial shows roughly 1.00 kHz. 

Step 4:  Read the period, the frequency and the peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p of the displayed signal off the 

oscilloscope display.  

Step 5:  Draw the waveform as seen on the screen.  Record the TIME/DIV and VOLT/DIV settings.. 

Step 6:  Is the value of the frequency measured using the oscilloscope (Step 4), in agreement with the 

reading of the frequency display of the function generator? 

31 

 
 
  
 
 
Step 7:  Set up the DMM to operate as an AC voltmeter. 

Step 8:  Measure the voltage of the displayed signal using the DMM. Compare your reading to the 

peak-to-peak voltage, Vp-p, from Step 4.  Do both measurements agree? If so, why? If not, why 
not? Can you conclude what quantity (e.g. average voltage, RMS voltage, peak voltage 
amplitude, or peak-to-peak voltage) the DMM measures? 

Step 9:  Keep the voltage constant at 6 Vp-p, but change the signal frequency to 100 kHz.  Use the 

oscilloscope, to measure the period and the frequency of the displayed waveform.  

Step 10: Keeping the frequency constant, at 100 kHz, change the voltage level to 0.6 Vp-p. Use the 

oscilloscope to measure the peak-to-peak voltage, Vp-p , Sketch the waveform and record the 
VOLT/DIV setting used. 

Step 11: Display a triangular waveform of 6 Vp-p, and at a frequency of 10 kHz, on the oscilloscope.  

Sketch it in your lab book and label the axes clearly. 

Step 12: Display a square waveform (with no DC offset) of 6 Vp-p, and at a frequency of 1 kHz, on the 

oscilloscope.  Sketch it in your lab book and label the axes clearly.

using an oscilloscope.

In order to observe the transient response on the oscilloscope, the R-C circuit will be driven with a 
periodic square wave signal. This is equivalent to opening and closing the switch in the circuit in Figure 
4.2.  The period of the square wave should be much longer than the time constant, τ of the circuit (τ = 
RC), to allow the circuit to reach its steady state between successive transitions. 

Because both vertical channels of the oscilloscope have one input terminal grounded, all measurements 
made by the oscilloscope use the ground as a reference (i.e. no “floating” measurements are possible).  
Currents cannot be measured directly with an oscilloscope.  To allow monitoring of the current, i (t), a 
small resistor, Rc is placed in series with the capacitor, C, as shown in Figure 4.3 and its voltage is 
c << , the voltage drop across Rc is small compared to the 
monitored.  As long as  R

Procedure: 

Step 1:  Set the function generator to a square-wave output.  Use the oscilloscope to adjust the 
amplitude to 6 Vp-p (as in Step 12 of Part 4.1), but set the frequency to 500 Hz. 

Step 2:  Connect the circuit in Figure 4.3 as you have drawn it in part iv) of the preparation. Display 

simultaneously the capacitor voltage, vc(t), on CH1, and the voltage, vRc(t) across the resistor, 
Rc on CH2. 

Step 3:  Sketch the voltage, vc(t) and the current, i(t) waveforms.  Use identical time scales, and align 

the origins.  Label time, voltage and current scales.

Step 4:  Explain in qualitative terms, the relationship between vc(t) and i(t). 

Step 5:  Now, display simultaneously the voltage across the capacitor, vc(t) on CH1, and the input 

voltage, vi(t) on CH2, using DC coupling. 

Step 6:  Add the waveform of vi(t) to the existing vc(t) and i(t) sketches from step 4.  Align the 

corresponding time scales and explain the relationships of these signals. 

Step 7:  Measure the time constant, τ of the RC-circuit.  The time constant is defined as the time it takes 

for the voltage across the capacitor, vc(t) to complete 63% of its total change from the most 
negative to the most positive voltage.  Enter the value of τ in Table 4.1. 

Step 8:  Replace the 10 nF capacitor with a 1 nF capacitor.  Increase the frequency of the input signal to 

5 kHz and measure the time constant, τ, again.  Enter it in Table 4.1. 

Step 9:  Comment on the theoretically expected and experimentally obtained values of τ.
