Question 3 [2 Marks]
Write a single C statement that will compute the value of r according to the following expression,
and assign the value to r.

r =

xn + 6 × x4
sin(y) + cos−1(z)

You can assume that all the variables in the expression are already declared as double types, and
that the math library (described by the header ﬁle math.h) is available, and that the value of y
and z is in radians.

r = (pow(x, n) + 6 * pow(x, 4.0)) / (sin(y) + acos(z));

Question 9 [2 Marks]

There have been ﬁve plenary lectures so far in this course, and there is one question from each
below. You should give a written answer from two of these ﬁve questions. The answer should be
one or two sentences. If you answer more than two questions, you must indicate which two you
wish to be graded; if you do not indicate which, then the ﬁrst two in order will be graded.

Plenary Lecture 1 – Creative Application for Mobile Devices. What does it mean when we say
that smartphones allow an application to scale? Give an example.

Solution: Once an applications works, it can be deployed to everyone in the world who has
compatible smartphones – for example, if an application for diagnosing a skin disease can work,
it can be deployed to everyone in the world with a compatible camera.

Plenary Lecture 2 – Software at Google Scale. How did Google make clever use of its computer
servers when they were not being used?

Solution: When one part of the world was more likely to be sleeping, and therefore making less
use of the local servers, those would be used to help the part of the world that was awake, and
needing more compute power?

Plenary Lecture 3 – From Smartphones to the Cloud. What does an object contain?

Solution: Variables and Functions, also known as methods.

Plenary Lecture 4 – Software Companies – Pheedloop and Konnectivity. In one sentence each,
describe what service is provided by the companies Konnectivity and Pheedloop.

Solution: Konnectivity allows people in a geographic area, at a conference, to meet people who
would be of interest to them, after describing their own proﬁle. Pheedloop allows speakers to
obtain fast feedback from their audience.

Plenary Lecture 5 – An EE’s Journey to the Software Side. Name one of the things (systems) that
Professor Betz talked about using software to optimize (i.e. make better). In addition, say, in one
sentence, what was being optimized.

7

Solution: Three possible answers: Antenna for US Navy, optimizing the radiation or efﬁciency of
antenna. MRI - optimizing the design of the MRI magnets, or the shielding of the system. Design
of a computer chip - optimizing the sizing of transistors (or anything close to that).

Question 10 [6 Marks]

In Canada, different tax rates are used depending on the taxpayer’s marital status and income.
The table below gives the tax rate computations for a single person, using the values for the 2013
federal tax return.

If the taxable income is over But not over

$0
$43,561
$87,123
$135,054

$43,561
$87,123
$135,054

The tax is
15%
6534.15 + 22%
16118.79 + 26%
28580.85 + 29%

Of the amount over
$0
$43,561
$87,123
$135,054

Write a C program that asks the user to enter the taxable income, and then prints out the federal
tax owing on that income, to two decimal places.

Your program should match the output of these example runs:

Example Run 1:

Enter your taxable income: 21346.00
Your federal tax is $3201.90

Example Run 2:

Enter your taxable income: 34500.00
Your federal tax is $5175.00

Example Run 3:

Enter your taxable income: 53000.00
Your federal tax is $8610.73

Solution:

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {

const double LEVEL1 = 0.0, LEVEL2 = 43561.0,

LEVEL3 = 87123.0, LEVEL4 = 135054.0;

const double RATE1 = 0.15, RATE2 = 0.22, RATE3 = 0.26, RATE4 = 0.29;
const double BASE1 = 0.0, BASE2 = 6534.15,

BASE3 = 16118.79, BASE4 = 28580.85;

double income, tax;

printf("Enter your taxable income: ");
scanf("%lf", &income);

if(income <= LEVEL2)

9

tax=income*RATE1;

else if(income <= LEVEL3)

tax=BASE2 + (income-LEVEL2)*RATE2;

else if(income<=LEVEL4)

tax=BASE3 + (income-LEVEL3)*RATE3;

else

tax=BASE4 + (income-LEVEL4)*RATE4;

printf("Your federal tax is $%.2lf\n", tax);
return (0);

}

Question 11 [6 Marks]
Please write a C program that repeatedly prompts the user to enter two integer numbers (num1
and num2). For each pair of numbers, the program computes the remainder of the integer division
of num1 by num2, but the modulus (%) operator must not be used. The remainder for each pair is
to be printed. You can assume that neither of the inputs are zeros. The program should terminate
when at least one of the inputs is a negative number.
Again, you may only use the basic arithmetic operators in this program: +, -, *, and /. You may
not use the % operator.

The output of your program should match the example run shown below:

Please enter two integer numbers: 10 3
10 % 3 = 1

Please enter two integer numbers: 25 5
25 % 5 = 0

Please enter two integer numbers: 2 3
2 % 3 = 2

Please enter two integer numbers: 10 -5
Goodbye.

Solution:

int main(void) {

int num1, num2, divide, multiply, remainder;

printf("Please enter two integer numbers: ");

scanf("%d%d", &num1, &num2);

while(num1 > 1 && num2 > 1) {
divide
/ num2;
= num1
multiply = divide * num2;
remainder = num1

- multiply;

printf("%d %% %d = %d\n\n", num1, num2, remainder);

printf("Please enter two integer numbers: ");
scanf("%d%d", &num1, &num2);
}
printf("Goodbye.");
return 0;
}

Question 12 [6 Marks]

Write a C program that prompts the user to enter three lower-case letter and then prints them out
in alphabetical order. (You can assume that the three letters are all lower case.)

The program’s input and output sequence should look like these examples, each time it is run:
Example Run 1:

Enter three lower-case letters: cvb
Output in alphabetical order: bcv

Example Run 2:

Enter three lower-case letters: zxy
Output in alphabetical order: xyz

Example Run 3:

Enter three lower-case letters: abc
Output in alphabetical order: abc

Example Run 4:

Enter three lower-case letters: ddb
Output in alphabetical order: bdd

Solution:

int main(void) {

char a,b,c;

printf("Enter three lower-case letters: ");
scanf("%c%c%c",&a,&b,&c);

printf("Output in alphabetical order: ");

if (a <= b && a <= c) {
printf("%c",a);

if (b<=c) printf("%c%c",b,c);
else printf("%c%c",c,b);

}

else if (b <=c && b <= a) {

printf("%c",b);

if (a<=c) printf("%c%c",a,c);
else printf("%c%c",c,a);

12

}

else {

printf("%c",c);

if (a<=b) printf("%c%c",a,b);
else printf("%c%c",b,a);

}

return (EXIT_SUCCESS);

}

Question 13 [6 Marks]

In this question, you are to complete the code for a function and its calling in a main program. The
functions is called sumAndProductOfMultiples; it takes integers multiple1 and multiple2,
and a maximum bound max as input, and computes both the sum and the product of all the posi-
tive integers less than max that are multiples of either multiple1 or multiple2.

For example, if multiple1 = 3, multiple2 = 5, and max = 10, the positive integers less
than 10 that are multiples of either 3 or 5 are 3, 5, 6, 9. Their sum is 23, and their product is
810. The function must return the sum and product values via pointer parameters sumPtr and
productPtr, as implied in the skeleton code below.

In the code skeleton below, you are given most of the main function, but you must give the call to
the sumAndProductOfMultiples function. After that you are given just the declaration line of
the function, and you must write the remainder of the function.
Solution:

void sumAndProductOfMultiples(int multiple1, int multiple2, int max, int *sumPtr, int *productPtr);

int main(void)
{

int multi1 = 3, multi2 = 5, max = 10;
int sum, product;

// add your call to sumAndProductOfMultiples here:

sumAndProductOfMultiples(multi1, multi2, max, &sum, &product);

printf("m1 = %d, m2 = %d, max = %d, sum = %d, product = %d\n",

multi1, multi2, max, sum, product);

return 0;

}

void sumAndProductOfMultiples(int multiple1, int multiple2, int max, int *sumPtr, int *productPtr)
{

*sumPtr = 0, *productPtr = 1;
int i;
for (i = 1; i < max; i ++) {

if (i % multiple1 == 0 || i % multiple2 == 0) {

*sumPtr += i;
*productPtr *= i;

}

}

}

Question 14 [6 Marks]

Write a complete C program that ﬁrst prompts the user for a number of rows (with the assumption
that the user enters a valid number between 0 and 26 inclusive), and then prints a pattern of letters
that appears exactly like the following examples:

When the number of rows is 3 it should print:

ABC
BCA
CAB

When the number of rows is 10 it should print::

ABCDEFGHIJ
BCDEFGHIJA
CDEFGHIJAB
DEFGHIJABC
EFGHIJABCD
FGHIJABCDE
GHIJABCDEF
HIJABCDEFG
IJABCDEFGH
JABCDEFGHI

If a user enters 0 as the number of rows, nothing will be printed.

Solution:

int main(void) {

int numberOfRows;

printf("Please enter the number of rows: ");
scanf("%d", &numberOfRows);

int row, col;
for (row = 1; row <= numberOfRows; row++) {

for (col = 1; col <= numberOfRows; col++) {

printf("%c", ’A’ + ((row + col - 2) % numberOfRows));

}
printf("\n");

}
return 0;

}
