expand under three different conditions.

temperature and the work done. [6 pts]

Calculate the final temperature and the work done. [6 pts]

value as the final volume in part (a). Determine the value of the final volume and the final pressure 
of this reversible isothermal expansion. [4 pts]

performed? On the diagram, shade the area that represents the difference in the work done in process (a) 
and process (c) [4 pts]

is 0.000596 g/cm3. If the enthalpy of evaporation of water at atmospheric pressure is 40.63 
kJ/mol, what is ΔU? How much work is done by the system during the evaporation process?
