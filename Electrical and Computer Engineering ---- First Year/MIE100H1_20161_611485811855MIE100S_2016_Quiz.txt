1.  The particles A and B both move in a circle of radius 40 meters around the origin in the 
directions shown.  At time t = 0 seconds, the particles are at the position shown in the 
diagram. The speed of A is 5t and the speed of B is 2t, where the parameter “t” represents time 
in seconds. Angle  is measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis, as shown.

(a)  Determine the unit vector for the direction of the  
initial velocity particle B as soon as it starts to  
move. Express your answer in terms of its    and     
components, using the x-y rectangular coordinate  
system shown in the diagram.

2.  The ground is sloped at     as shown in the diagram. A cannon ball is shot from the origin 
into the air at time t = 0. Ignore air resistance. Initial velocity of the cannon ball is 57 m/s, at 
an angle of 60 degrees above the horizontal. Angle  is measured counter-clockwise from the 
positive x-axis.

(a)  Determine the position       of the cannon ball as a function of time t measured in 

seconds. Express your answer in terms of its    and    components, using the rectangular x-y 
coordinate system shown in the diagram. 

(b) Find the radius of curvature of the cannon ball’s path immediately after launch. 
(c)  Determine the velocity of the cannon ball in polar (r-) coordinates when it crosses the  

x-axis at point B. 

(d) Determine the time at which the cannon ball hits the ground at point C.
