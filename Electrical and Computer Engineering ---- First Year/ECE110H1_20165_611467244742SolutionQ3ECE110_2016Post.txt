Q1 [3 Marks] Circle the correct answer. 

i.  The  Figure  shows  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  (B)  and  4  loops  of  equal  areas.  Which  loop  has  the 

smallest magnetic ﬂux? 

Answer is d. 

ii. 

In  the  Figure  shown,  if  the  current  (i)  in  the  outer  loop  is  counter-clockwise  and 
decreasing, then the current in the inner loop is clockwise. 

a)  True 

b)  False 

Answer is b (False). 

i 

iii. 

In  the  Figure  shown,  as  the  positive  charge  enters  the  region  where  the  magnetic  ﬁeld 
exists then the charge will be: 

Answer is c. 

 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
Q2 [7 Marks] Consider a very long straight wire carrying current i in the direction of x-axis as 
shown  in  the  Figure  below.  At  time  t=0  the  current  in  this  wire  is  increased  from 
i=1A to i=21A in 20 µsec. 
A  rectangular  loop  of  wire  of  width  x=1m  and  length  y=2m  is  located  at  distance 
s=1m from the current carrying wire.  

a)  Derive a relation for the magnetic flux in terms of i, x, y, and s.   
b)  Determine the magnitude of the induced emf in the loop of wire while current 

changing. 

c)  Indicate the direction of induced current in the loop of wire. Justify.
