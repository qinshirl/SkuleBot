Question 1 [35 marks total] 

A particle P travels along y = 25 such that x = 4t3; time is measured in seconds and 
x and y are in meters. 

a)  Find  the  velocity  of  P  at  t  =  1s.  Use  the  rectangular  co-ordinates  shown.      

[5  Marks] 

b)  Find  the  velocity  of  P  at  t  =  2s.  Use  normal  and  tangential  co-ordinates.    

[10 Marks] 

c)  Find the position of particle P at t = 3s. Use polar co-ordinates centered at O.   

[5 Marks] 

d)  Find  the  acceleration  of  P  at  t  =  3s.  Use  polar  co-ordinates  centered  at  O.   

[15 Marks]

Question 2 [30 marks total] 

A 1500  kg car enters a  section of curved road in the  horizontal plane and slows 
down at a uniform rate from a speed of 100 km/h at A to a speed of 50 km/h as it 
passes C. The radius of curvature ρ of the road at A is 400 m and at C is 80 m and 
point B is the inflection point  (where it is instantaneously straight)  of the curved 
path ABC. 

(Hint: For parts (c) and (d) below, treat the car as a particle and find the external 
forces as required.) 

a)  What is the constant tangential acceleration? [10 Marks] 

b)  What is the normal component of the acceleration at B? [5 Marks] 

c)  Determine the total horizontal force exerted by the road on the car when 

it is at position B.    [5 Marks] 

d)  Determine  the  total  horizontal  force  exerted  on  the  car  when  it  is  at 
position  C.    Use  normal  and  tangential  co0ordinates  to  express  your 
answer. [10 Marks]

Question 3 [35 marks total] 

The  collar  has  a  mass  of  2  kg  and  is  attached  to  the  light  spring,  which  has  a 
stiffness of 30 N/m and an unstretched length of 1.5 m. The collar is released from 
rest at A and slides up the smooth rod under the action of the constant 50 N force. 

a)  What is the potential energy of the spring at time t=0? [10 Marks] 

b)  Find the velocity of the collar as it passes position B. [15 Marks] 

c)  Draw a free body diagram of the collar when it is in position B. Indicate the 
direction (as they act on the mass) of all forces in the plane of motion. It is 
not necessary to calculate their magnitudes.[10 Marks]
