Instructions
• This is a Type A assessment and does not allow any external aids.
• Read all instructions carefully and justify all your answers. No points will be awarded for a correct

answer without justification.

• Read each question carefully. No clarification or content related questions will be answered.

You may use the following space for scratch work or to continue your solutions if you run out of room. If
you do so, please clearly indicate in the original question that part of your solution appears here.

1. (2 points) Explain in words the qualitative difference between a stable and an unstable equilibrium.

Solution: A stable equilibrium is one where nearby solutions tend to move toward the equi-
librium over time, meaning small disturbances away from die out and the solution settles back at
the equilibrium. An unstable equilibrium is one where nearby solutions move away from the
equilibrium, so small disturbances grow over time, never returning to the equilibrium.

2. (3 points) Can the ODE

y′ − eyy = ex

be solved with the method of integrating factors? Justify your answer. Which types of ODE does the
method of integrating factor apply to?

Solution: The method of integrating factors applies to first-order, linear differential equations
of the form

y′ + P (x)y = Q(x),

where both P (x) and Q(x) are functions of x only, and the equation is linear in y.

The given ODE is

y′ − eyy = ex.

We observe that the term eyy depends nonlinearly on y, since it is the product of y and an
exponential function of y. Therefore, the equation is not linear in y, and does not match the
required form for applying an integrating factor.

3. (4 points) You’re told that the salt concentration C(t) in a well-mixed tank increases quickly at first
and then levels off over time. Which of the following differential equations could model this behavior?

A.

dC
dt

= −kC

B.

dC
dt

= k(Cin − C)

C.

dC
dt

= k

Explain your reasoning.

Solution: Answer: B.

This equation models a situation where the concentration approaches a limiting value Cin over
time. If the initial concentration is below Cin, then dC/dt is initially large and positive. As C
approaches Cin, the rate of change decreases, and the concentration levels off.
Option A represents exponential decay, where the concentration decreases toward zero. Option
C represents constant growth; the concentration increases linearly over time and never levels off.

4. (5 points) Consider the nonlinear differential equation
y′′ = 6y2

Determine whether the function

y(x) =

1
(Ax + B)2

satisfies the equation. Find any constraints on the constants A and B that are required for it to be a
solution.

Solution: Let us compute the first and second derivatives of y(x). First,

y′ =

d
dx

(cid:0)(Ax + B)−2(cid:1) = −2A(Ax + B)−3.

Next, the second derivative is

y′′ =

d
dx

(cid:0)−2A(Ax + B)−3(cid:1) = 6A2(Ax + B)−4.

Now we compute the right-hand side of the differential equation:

6y2 = 6

(cid:18)

1
(Ax + B)2

(cid:19)2

= 6(Ax + B)−4.

We see that for the ODE to be satisfied, we need:

y′′ = 6A2(Ax + B)−4 = 6(Ax + B)−4 = 6y2
A2 = 1
A = ±1

⇒

Conclusion: The function y(x) =
that A = ±1. The constant B can be any real number.

1

(Ax+B)2 satisfies the differential equation y′′ = 6y2 provided

5. (6 points) Solve the initial value problem

y′ − 2y = e3x,

y(0) = 2

Solution: This is a linear first-order ODE and can be solved using the method of integrating
factors. The standard form is

with P (x) = −2 and Q(x) = e3x

Compute the integrating factor.

y′ + P (x)y = Q(x),

´

µ(x) = e

−2 dx = e−2x

Multiply both sides of the ODE by the integrating factor:

e−2xy′ − 2e−2xy = ex

d
dx

(e−2xy) = ex

ˆ

Integrate both sides:

ˆ

d
dx

(e−2xy) dx =

ex dx

⇒

e−2xy = ex + C

⇒

y(x) = e3x + Ce2x

Apply the initial condition y(0) = 1:

Final Answer:

2 = e0 + Ce0 = 1 + C ⇒ C = 1

y(x) = e3x + e2x

6. A cup of tea is initially at a temperature of 85◦C and is left to cool in a room that is kept at 20◦C.
According to Newton’s Law of Cooling, the rate at which the tea cools is proportional to the difference
between its temperature and the ambient temperature.

(a) (7 points) Write and solve an initial value problem for the temperature T (t) of the tea at time

t (in minutes), assuming the cooling constant is k = 0.1.

Solution: Newton’s Law of Cooling gives the differential equation:

where Tenv = 20 and k = 0.1. Substituting in:

dT
dt

= −k(T − Tenv),

dT
dt

= −0.1(T − 20).

This is a separable equation. We separate variables and integrate:

ˆ

1
T − 20

ˆ

dT = −0.1

dt ⇒ ln |T − 20| = −0.1t + C.

Exponentiating both sides:

where A = eC > 0, so:

|T − 20| = e−0.1t+C = Ae−0.1t,

T (t) = 20 + Ae−0.1t.

Apply the initial condition T (0) = 85:

Final answer:

85 = 20 + A ⇒ A = 65.

T (t) = 20 + 65e−0.1t .

(b) (3 points) How long will it take for the tea to cool to 50◦C?

Solution: Set T (t) = 50 and solve for t:

50 = 20 + 65e−0.1t ⇒ 30 = 65e−0.1t ⇒ e−0.1t =

Take the natural logarithm:
