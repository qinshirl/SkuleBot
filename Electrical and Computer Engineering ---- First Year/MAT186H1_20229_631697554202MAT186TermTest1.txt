1. This test contains a total of 13 pages.

2. DO NOT DETACH ANY PAGES FROM THIS TEST.

3. There are no aids permitted for this test, including calculators.

4. Cellphones, smartwatches, or any other electronic devices are not permitted. They must be turned oﬀ and in your

bag under your desk or chair. These devices may not be left in your pockets.

5. Write clearly and concisely in a linear fashion. Organize your work in a reasonably neat and coherent way.

6. Show your work and justify your steps on every question unless otherwise indicated. A correct answer without
explanation will receive no credit unless otherwise noted; an incorrect answer supported by substantially correct
calculations and explanations may receive partial credit.

7. For questions with a boxed area, ensure your answer is completely inside the box.

8. The back side of pages will not be scanned nor graded. Use the back side of pages for rough work only.

9. You must use the methods learned in this course to solve all of the problems.

10. DO NOT START the test until instructed to do so.

GOOD LUCK!
