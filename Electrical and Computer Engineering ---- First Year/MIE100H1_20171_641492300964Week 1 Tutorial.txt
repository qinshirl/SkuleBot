Tutorial Problem 01a 

A freighter is moving at 4 m/s. After the engines are shut off, it decelerates proportionally with the square 
of the velocity: i.e. a=-kυ2 . If it takes 10 minutes to reduce its speed to 2 m/s find the distance travelled in 
those 10 minutes and its speed as a function of time during the interval.

Tutorial Problem 01b 

At the instant shown, slider block B is moving with a constant acceleration, and its speed is 180 mm/s. 
After slider block A is moved 240 mm to the right, its velocity is 60 mm/s. 

a)  Determine the accelerations of A and B. 
b)  Determine the velocity and the change in position of slider block B after 4 s.
