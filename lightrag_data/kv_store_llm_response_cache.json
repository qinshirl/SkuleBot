Therefore, $(-1,-4)$ is a global minimum.\r\n\r\n2. The function $y=x^3+x^2-8x-12$ has one positive $x-1$ intercept. We build a rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides that has the origin as one vertex and a point on the graph of y for its opposite vertex. If this second point lies between the $y-$ and $x-$ intercepts of the graph, what value(s) would maximize the area of the rectangle?\r\n\r\nFactoring $y$, we get $y = (x+2)^2(x-3)$, so the second point has $0 \\leq  x \\leq  3$. We should also note that the point will have a negative $y$ value, as that will make a difference for the question.\r\n\r\nIf we write the point on the graph as $(x,x^3+x^2-8x-12)$ , then the area of the rectangle created would be $A(x)=-x(x^3+x^2-8x-12)$ , because of the negative coordinate. You can do the question without the negative for now, but it is a little trickier.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have $\n```",

You can do the question without the negative for now, but it is a little trickier.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have $A(x)=-x^{4}-x^{3}+8 x^{2}+12 x$ and can get going:\r\n\r\n$$A ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = - 4 x ^ { 3 } - 3 x ^ { 2 } + 1 6 x + 1 2 = 0$$\r\n\r\n$$( x + 2 ) ( 4 x + 3 ) ( x - 2 ) = 0$$\r\n\r\n$$x=-2,-\\frac{4}{3},2$$\r\n\r\nOf these, the first two points are outside our domain, so they can be dismissed. We are left with $x=2$ as the only critical point in the interval. We can compare its $y-$ value with that of the other two endpoints, analyze using the first derivative test, or go to the second derivative test, as long as we do\r\n\r\nContinued on back.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nat least one of them. If you did not realize earlier that the point lies below the axis, you will find that $x=2$ gives a minimum, but that it is still the correct value.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the maximum area occurs at $x=2$.\r\n\r\n## 3. Use two linear approximations (that is, use a different initial point each time) to estimate $\\sqrt[3]{4}$\r\n\r\nYou will find that the better approximation has a larger value for dx (for comparison $\\sqrt[3]{4} \\approx 1.59$ ). How could this happen?\r\n\r\nI took a gamble here that everyone would use the function $y = \\sqrt[3]{x}$ and attempt to use $a = 1$ and $a = 8$. (Note that $a = 0$ will not work because $y$ is not differentiable there.)\r\n\r\nFor our function, we have $y'=\\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}$. We have:\n```",

How could this happen?\r\n\r\nI took a gamble here that everyone would use the function $y = \\sqrt[3]{x}$ and attempt to use $a = 1$ and $a = 8$. (Note that $a = 0$ will not work because $y$ is not differentiable there.)\r\n\r\nFor our function, we have $y'=\\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}$. We have:\r\n\r\n<table><tr><td>a</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>y(a)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>dx=x-a</td><td>3</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>m=y'(a)</td><td>1/3</td><td>1/12</td></tr><tr><td>dy=m·dx</td><td>1</td><td>-1/3</td></tr><tr><td>$\\sqrt[3]{4}\\approx y(a)+dy$</td><td>2</td><td>5/3</td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways of thinking about why $a=8$ gives the more accurate answer. It originates with the fact that the graph of $y=\\sqrt[3]{x}$ is `more flat' the further you go. That is, its second derivative is smaller, so the graph stays close to its tangent lines for longer. We can also think about the tangent lines themselves $-$ since the function is concave down, the lines all lie above the graph, but at $x=4$, the tangent line that starts at $a=8$ lies below the one from $a=1$.\r\n\r\n[The following question is strictly to help with older marks – the mark will NOT lower your grade.

Therefore, $(-1,-4)$ is a global minimum.\r\n\r\n2. The function $y=x^3+x^2-8x-12$ has one positive $x-1$ intercept. We build a rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides that has the origin as one vertex and a point on the graph of y for its opposite vertex. If this second point lies between the $y-$ and $x-$ intercepts of the graph, what value(s) would maximize the area of the rectangle?\r\n\r\nFactoring $y$, we get $y = (x+2)^2(x-3)$, so the second point has $0 \\leq  x \\leq  3$. We should also note that the point will have a negative $y$ value, as that will make a difference for the question.\r\n\r\nIf we write the point on the graph as $(x,x^3+x^2-8x-12)$ , then the area of the rectangle created would be $A(x)=-x(x^3+x^2-8x-12)$ , because of the negative coordinate.

You can do the question without the negative for now, but it is a little trickier.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have $A(x)=-x^{4}-x^{3}+8 x^{2}+12 x$ and can get going:\r\n\r\n$$A ^ { \\prime } ( x ) = - 4 x ^ { 3 } - 3 x ^ { 2 } + 1 6 x + 1 2 = 0$$\r\n\r\n$$( x + 2 ) ( 4 x + 3 ) ( x - 2 ) = 0$$\r\n\r\n$$x=-2,-\\frac{4}{3},2$$\r\n\r\nOf these, the first two points are outside our domain, so they can be dismissed.

If you did not realize earlier that the point lies below the axis, you will find that $x=2$ gives a minimum, but that it is still the correct value.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the maximum area occurs at $x=2$.\r\n\r\n## 3.

How could this happen?\r\n\r\nI took a gamble here that everyone would use the function $y = \\sqrt[3]{x}$ and attempt to use $a = 1$ and $a = 8$. (Note that $a = 0$ will not work because $y$ is not differentiable there.)\r\n\r\nFor our function, we have $y'=\\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}$.

How could this happen?\r\n\r\nI took a gamble here that everyone would use the function $y = \\sqrt[3]{x}$ and attempt to use $a = 1$ and $a = 8$. (Note that $a = 0$ will not work because $y$ is not differentiable there.)\r\n\r\nFor our function, we have $y'=\\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}$. We have:\r\n\r\n<table><tr><td>a</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>y(a)</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>dx=x-a</td><td>3</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>m=y'(a)</td><td>1/3</td><td>1/12</td></tr><tr><td>dy=m·dx</td><td>1</td><td>-1/3</td></tr><tr><td>$\\sqrt[3]{4}\\approx y(a)+dy$</td><td>2</td><td>5/3</td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways of thinking about why $a=8$ gives the more accurate answer. It originates with the fact that the graph of $y=\\sqrt[3]{x}$ is `more flat' the further you go. That is, its second derivative is smaller, so the graph stays close to its tangent lines for longer. We can also think about the tangent lines themselves $-$ since the function is concave down, the lines all lie above the graph, but at $x=4$, the tangent line that starts at $a=8$ lies below the one from $a=1$.\r\n\r\n[The following question is strictly to help with older marks – the mark will NOT lower your grade.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n3.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n4.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\nThe input text is from an exam or syllabus.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\nThe input text is from an exam or syllabus.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n3.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n4.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\nThe input text is from an exam or syllabus.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n3.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n4.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\nThe input text is from an exam or syllabus.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n3.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n4.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\nThe input text is from an exam or syllabus.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n4.  **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n5.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks, explanations, or additional text before or after the list.\n6.  **Completion Signal:** Output `<|COMPLETE|>` as the final line after all relevant missing or corrected entities and relationships have been extracted and presented.\n7.  **Output Language:** Ensure the output language is English. Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) must be kept in their original language and not translated.\n\n<Output>\n---Role---\nYou are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.\nThe input text is from an exam or syllabus.\n\n---Instructions---\n1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.\n    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course,Textbook,Marking_Scheme,Office,Chapter`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**.

Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n\n3.

Any version of this book will do. The standalone physical book has ISBN 978-0321-785374 and should be available – new or used – at any of the three textbook stores around campus. For a price very similar to a new textbook you can obtain a package, ISBN 978-0321-837721, which includes the textbook and an Access Card which will allow you to access MyMathLab and an online interactive version of the textbook, with solutions manuals and an additional chapter on Second Order Differential Equations. The third and cheapest option is to buy just the online version, ISBN 978-0321-785800, at http://www.mymathlab.com The course ID is: burbulla77566 . (Access Code kits will be available separately for students who already have a physical copy of the book and would like access to the online version.)\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>Textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Textbook<|#|>textbook<|#|>The textbook of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMarking Scheme: WeBWorK Assignments: 5%; Test 1: 20%; Test 2: 25%; Exam: 50%\n```\n\n<Output>\nentity<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\nrelation<|#|>MAT186H1<|#|>MAT186H1_Marking_Scheme<|#|>Marking_Scheme<|#|>The Marking Scheme of MAT186H1\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\n\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'syllabus'\n}\n\nMath Aid Office: GB 149.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `question,concept,Quiz,Course`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.\n        *   Format: `entity<|#|>entity_name<|#|>entity_type<|#|>entity_description\\n`\n\n2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**\n    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.\n    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.\n        *   **Example:** For \"Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X,\" extract binary relationships such as \"Alice collaborated with Project X,\" \"Bob collaborated with Project X,\" and \"Carol collaborated with Project X,\" or \"Alice collaborated with Bob,\" based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.\n    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:\n        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**.

Without solving the integral , explain why this is likely not a good choice for integration by parts.\r\n\r\nSolution: With this choice of $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ and $g'(x) = x$ , we are differentiating $\\sin(x)$ , which gives $\\cos(x)$ , and integrating $x$ , which gives $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$ . This results in more complicated expressions during the integration by parts process.\r\n\r\nA better choice is to let $f(x) = x$ and $g'(x) = \\sin(x)$ , because differentiating $x$ simplifies to 1, and integrating $\\sin(x)$ yields $-\\cos(x)$ , which simplifies the integrand.

Explain why partial fraction decomposition is not a suitable method for evaluating this integral.\r\n\r\nSolution: The denominator $1+x^2$ is an irreducible quadratic polynomial as it cannot be factored into linear terms using real numbers.

Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   each record should be a single line, followed by a new line charactor, do not use <|#|> as new line\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   if the entity is a question, the entity name should include course_code(in extra_data), year(in extra_data), doc_name(in extra_data), question number, subquestion number if there is one, joined by '_'.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n9.  **concept entity requirement:**\n    *   The concept may or may not appear in the question, you should extract as if you are the math teacher.\n    \n10. **extra data:**\n    *   Extra data may be provided at the start of Input with json format after 'extra_data:' if present, extract course information as entity and append as prefix to the entity name as well as shown in the example.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nextra_data:\n{\n    'course_code': 'MAT186H1',\n    'year': '2025',\n    'doc_name': 'Quiz8'\n}\n3.
