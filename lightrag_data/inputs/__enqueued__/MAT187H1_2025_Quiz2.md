1. (4 points) Consider the improper integral:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\langle  x+1\rangle} d x$$

Define what it means for this improper integral to converge or diverge. You do not need to evaluate the integral — just explain the definition.

Solution: This integrand has vertical asymptotes at $x=-1$ , so the function is not continuous on the interval $(-\infty,\infty)$ . Additionally, the interval of integration is infinite.

To evaluate the convergence of this integral, we must break it into parts at the discontinuities and use limits. The integral is defined as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(x+1)} d x= & \lim _{a \to-\infty} \int_{a}^{-2} \frac{1}{(x+1)} d x+\lim _{b \to 1^{-}} \int_{-2}^{b} \frac{1}{(x+1)} d x \\
& +\lim _{c \to 1^{+}} \int_{c}^{0} \frac{1}{(x+1)} d x+\lim _{d \to \infty} \int_{0}^{d} \frac{1}{(x+1)} d x
\end{aligned}$$

The integral converges only if all four limits exist and are finite . If any one of these limits does not exist or is infinite, the integral is said to diverge . Note that we do not need to split the integrals at $x=-2$ and $x=0$ , any points above and below $x=-1$ will work.

2. (3 points) True or False: If $f(x) \leq  g(x)$ for all $x \geq 1$ , and $\int_1^\infty g(x) \, dx$ converges, then it implies that $\int_1^\infty f(x) \, dx$ also converges. Justify your answer.

Solution: False. The statement is not always true without an additional assumption.

The comparison test requires that both functions be nonnegative on the interval. If $f(x) \leq  g(x)$ , but $f(x)$ takes on negative values , the conclusion about convergence may not hold.

Counterexample: Let $g(x)=\frac{1}{x^{2}}$, which is positive and

$$\int_{1}^{\infty} g(x) d x=\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^{2}} d x$$

converges.

Now let $f(x)=-1$, which satisfies $f(x) \leq  g(x)$ for all $x \geq 1$, but

$$\int_{1}^{\infty}f(x)dx=\int_{1}^{\infty}(-1)dx$$

diverges to $-\infty$. So, the original statement is false.

3. (3 points) Consider the improper integral:

$$\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^{p}} d x$$

For which values of $p>0$ does this integral converge? (No justification necessary.) Explain in words why the integral converges for some values of $p$ and diverges for others, even though $\frac{1}{x^p}\to 0$ as $x\to\infty$ for all $p>0$ .

Solution: The integral

$$\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^{p}} d x$$

converges if p > 1 and diverges if p ≤ 1. This is often referred to as the p-test.

Even though $\frac{1}{x^p} \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$ for all $p > 0$ , the rate at which the function approaches zero determines whether the total area under the curve is finite.

When $p \leq  1$ , the function decays too slowly — the “ tail ” of the function is thick enough that the area accumulates without bound, causing the integral to diverge.

When $p>1$ , the function decays quickly enough that the area under the curve from 1 to $\infty$ is finite, and so the integral converges.

4. (6 points) Evaluate the integral or show it diverges:

$$\int_{0}^{\infty} x e^{-x} d x$$

Solution: This is an improper integral due to the infinite upper limit. We evaluate it as a limit:

$$\int_{0}^{\infty} x e^{-x} d x=\lim _{t \to \infty} \int_{0}^{t} x e^{-x} d x$$

We compute the definite integral using integration by parts: Let

$$u=x \quad \Rightarrow \quad d u=d x, \quad d v=e^{-x} d x \quad \Rightarrow \quad v=-e^{-x}$$

Then:

$$\int x e^{-x} d x=-x e^{-x}+\int e^{-x} d x=-x e^{-x}-e^{-x}+C=-(x+1) e^{-x}+C$$

Now apply the limits:

$$\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{t}xe^{-x}dx&=\left[-(x+1)e^{-x}\right]_{0}^{t}\\
&=-(t+1)e^{-t}+(0+1)e^{0}\\
&=-(t+1)e^{-t}+1
\end{aligned}$$

Now take the limit as $t \to \infty$ :

$$\lim_{t\to\infty}\left[-(t+1)e^{-t}+1\right]=1$$

Final Answer: The integral converges and equals 1

5. (6 points) Determine whether the following improper integral converges or diverges. Justify your answer using the comparison test:

$$\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}+x^{2}} d x$$

Solution: As $x \to 0^{+}$, $\sqrt{x} \gg x^{2}$, so:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}+x^{2}} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$$

Thus we attempt to compare the integrand with $\frac{1}{\sqrt{s}}$ to show convergence.

Firstly note that $0 \leq  \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}+x^{2}}$, so we can apply the comparison test.

For 0<x<1, we have:

$$\sqrt{x}+x^{2}>\sqrt{x} \Rightarrow 0 \leq  \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}+x^{2}}<\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$$

Now,

$$\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} d x  converges by the  p -test$$

Therefore by the comparison test, $\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x+z^{2}}} d x$ converges.

6. (8 points) According to Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by:

$$F(r)=\frac{k q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}$$

where k is a positive constant.

The work required to move a particle from position $x=r_{1}$ to $x=r_{2}$ with a force $F(x)$ is given by:

$$Work=\int_{r_{1}}^{r_{2}} F(x) d x$$

Assuming both charges have the same sign (i.e., they repel each other), explain whether it is physically possible to bring the two charges to a distance of zero.

Solution: If the two charges have the same sign, they repel each other. To bring them closer together, an external agent must apply a force opposing this repulsion. The amount of work required is given by:

$$ Work =\int_{r_{1}}^{r_{2}} \frac{k q_{1} q_{2}}{x^{2}} d x$$

Since $q_1$ and $q_2$ are both positive (or both negative), $kq_1q_2>0$ , so the force is repulsive and points away from the other charge. To bring the charges together, we must integrate from $r_1>0$ to $r_2=0$ , which gives:

$$ Work =\int_{r_{1}}^{v} \frac{k q_{1} q_{2}}{x^{2}} d x$$

This is an improper integral because the integrand has a vertical asymptote at $x=0$ and by the $p$-test, this integral diverges.

Therefore, the work required to bring the charges to a distance of zero is infinite. This means that, in practice, it is physically impossible to bring two like charges all the way to $r=0$ , because it would require an infinite amount of energy.
