MAT291F - Calculus III

1. Let

$$f ( x , y ) = \frac { 1 } { 1 + x ^ { 2 } + y ^ { 2 } } + \frac { 1 } { 1 + x ^ { 2 } + ( y - 4 ) ^ { 2 } }$$

(a) (10 points) Find an equation of the plane tangent to the graph $z=f(x,y)$ of $f$ at the point $(0,3,0.6)$ .

(b) (5 points) Use $a$) to approximate the value of $f(0.1,2.99)$.
